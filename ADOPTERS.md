**[Glasnostic](https://glasnostic.com)**

Glasnostic makes modern cloud operations resilient. It does this by shaping how
systems interact, automatically and in real-time. As a result, DevOps and SRE
teams can deploy reliably, prevent failure and assure the customer experience.
We use Antrea's Open vSwitch support to tune how services interact in Kubernetes
clusters. We are @glasnostic on Twitter.
