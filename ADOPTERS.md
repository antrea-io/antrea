## Adding yourself as an Adopter

It would be great to have your logo on our list of Antrea adopters! To add yourself you can simply drop your logo in PNG or SVG format to the [adopters](docs/assets/adopters) directory and submit a pull request with your change. Name the image file something that reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme-logo.png). Check out the Antrea [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to create a pull request. Alternatively, feel free to reach out via Slack or on Github to have our team add your logo.

## Adding a logo to Antrea.io

We are working on adding an *Adopters* section on [antrea.io][1]. Follow the steps above to add your organization to the list of Antrea Adopters. We will follow up and publish it to the [antrea.io][1] website.
