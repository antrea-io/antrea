## What is Grafana Panel Plugin?

Panels are the building blocks of Grafana. They allow you to visualize data in different ways. While Grafana has several types of panels already built-in, you can also build your own panel, to add support for other visualizations.

For more information about panels, refer to the documentation on [Panels](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/panels/panels/)
