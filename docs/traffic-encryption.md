# Traffic Encryption with Antrea

Antrea supports encrypting traffic across Linux Nodes with IPsec ESP or
WireGuard. Traffic encryption is not supported on Windows Nodes yet.

## IPsec

IPsec encryption works for all tunnel types supported by OVS including Geneve,
GRE, VXLAN, and STT tunnel.

Note that GRE is not supported for IPv6 clusters (IPv6-only or dual-stack
clusters). For such clusters, please choose a different tunnel type such as
Geneve or VXLAN.

### Prerequisites

IPsec requires a set of Linux kernel modules. Check the required kernel modules
listed in the [strongSwan documentation](https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/KernelModules).
Make sure the required kernel modules are loaded on the Kubernetes Nodes before
deploying Antrea with IPsec encryption enabled.

If you want to enable IPsec with Geneve, please make sure [this commit](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/34beb21594519ce64a55a498c2fe7d567bc1ca20)
is included in the kernel. For Ubuntu 18.04, kernel version should be at least
`4.15.0-128`. For Ubuntu 20.04, kernel version should be at least `5.4.70`.

### Antrea installation

You can simply apply the [Antrea IPsec deployment yaml](../build/yamls/antrea-ipsec.yml)
to deploy Antrea with IPsec encryption enabled. To deploy a released version of
Antrea, pick a version from the [list of releases](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases).
Note that IPsec support was added in release 0.3.0, which means you can not
pick a release older than 0.3.0. For any given release `<TAG>` (e.g. `v0.3.0`),
get the Antrea IPsec deployment yaml at:

```text
https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea-ipsec.yml
```

To deploy the latest version of Antrea (built from the main branch), get the
IPsec deployment yaml at:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/build/yamls/antrea-ipsec.yml
```

Antrea leverages strongSwan as the IKE daemon, and supports using pre-shared key
(PSK) for IKE authentication. The deployment yaml creates a Kubernetes Secret
`antrea-ipsec` to store the PSK string. For security consideration, we recommend
to change the default PSK string in the yaml file. You can edit the yaml file,
and update the `psk` field in the `antrea-ipsec` Secret spec to any string you
want to use. Check the `antrea-ipsec` Secret spec below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: antrea-ipsec
  namespace: kube-system
stringData:
  psk: changeme
type: Opaque
```

After updating the PSK value, deploy Antrea with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f antrea-ipsec.yml
```

By default, the deployment yaml uses GRE as the tunnel type, which you can
change by editing the file. You will need to change the tunnel type to another
one if your cluster supports IPv6.

## WireGuard

Antrea can leverage [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) to encrypt Pod traffic
between Nodes. WireGuard encryption works like another tunnel type, and when it
is enabled the `tunnelType` parameter in the `antrea-agent` configuration file
will be ignored.

### Prerequisites

WireGuard encryption requires the `wireguard` kernel module be present on the
Kubernetes Nodes. `wireguard` module is part of mainline kernel since Linux 5.6.
Or, you can compile the module from source code with a kernel version >= 3.10.
[This WireGuard installation guide](https://www.wireguard.com/install) documents how to
install WireGuard together with the kernel module on various operating systems.

### Antrea installation

First, download the [Antrea deployment yaml](../build/yamls/antrea.yml). To deploy
a released version of Antrea, pick a version from the [list of releases](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases).
Note that WireGuard support was added in release 1.3.0, which means you can not
pick a release older than 1.3.0. For any given release `<TAG>` (e.g. `v1.3.0`),
get the Antrea deployment yaml at:

```text
https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea.yml
```

To deploy the latest version of Antrea (built from the main branch), get the
deployment yaml at:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/build/yamls/antrea.yml
```

To enable WireGuard encryption, the `trafficEncryptionMode` config parameter of
`antrea-agent` to `wireGuard`. The `trafficEncryptionMode` config parameter is
defined in `antrea-agent.conf` of `antrea` ConfigMap in the Antrea deployment
yaml:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: antrea-config
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  antrea-agent.conf: |
    trafficEncryptionMode: wireGuard
```

After saving the yaml file change, deploy Antrea with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f antrea.yml
```
