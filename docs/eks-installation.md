# Deploying Antrea in AWS EKS

This document describes steps to deploy Antrea in NetworkPolicy only mode to an AWS EKS cluster.

Assuming you already have an EKS cluster, and have ``KUBECONFIG`` environment variable point to
the kubeconfig file of that cluster.

With Antrea >=v0.9.0 release, you should apply `antrea-eks-node-init.yaml` before deploying Antrea.
This will restart existing Pods (except those in host network), so that Antrea can also manage them
(i.e. enforce NetworkPolicies on them) once it is installed.
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/master/build/yamls/antrea-eks-node-init.yml
```

To deploy a released version of Antrea, pick a deployment manifest from the
[list of releases](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/releases).
Note that EKS support was added in release 0.5.0, which means you cannot
pick a release older than 0.5.0. For any given release `<TAG>` (e.g. `v0.5.0`),
you can deploy Antrea as follows:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea-eks.yml
```

To deploy the latest version of Antrea (built from the master branch), use the
checked-in [deployment yaml](/build/yamls/antrea-eks.yml):
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/master/build/yamls/antrea-eks.yml
```

Now Antrea should be plugged into the EKS CNI and is ready to enforce NetworkPolicy.
