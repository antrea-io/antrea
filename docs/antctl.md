# Antctl

Antctl is the command-line tool for Antrea. At the moment, antctl supports
running in two different modes:

* "controller mode": when run out-of-cluster or from within the Antrea
  Controller Pod, antctl can connect to the Antrea Controller and query
  information from it (e.g. the set of computed NetworkPolicies).
* "agent mode": when run from within an Antrea Agent Pod, antctl can connect to
  the Antrea Agent and query information local to that Agent (e.g. the set of
  computed NetworkPolicies received by that Agent from the Antrea Controller, as
  opposed to the entire set of computed policies).

## Installation

The antctl binary is included in the Antrea Docker image
(`antrea/antrea-ubuntu`) which means that there is no need to install anything
to connect to the Antrea Agent. Simply exec into the antrea-agent container for
the appropriate antrea-agent Pod and run `antctl`:

```bash
kubectl exec -it ANTREA-AGENT_POD_NAME -n kube-system -c antrea-agent bash
> antctl help
```

Starting with Antrea release v0.5.0, we publish the antctl binaries for
different OS / CPU Architecture combinations. Head to the [releases
page](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/releases) and download the
appropriate one for your machine. For example:

On Mac & Linux:

```bash
curl -Lo ./antctl "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antctl-$(uname)-x86_64"
chmod +x ./antctl
mv ./antctl /some-dir-in-your-PATH/antctl
antctl version
```

For Linux, we also publish binaries for Arm-based systems.

On Windows, using PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antctl-windows-x86_64.exe -Outfile antctl.exe
Move-Item .\antctl.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\antctl.exe
antctl version
```

## Usage

To see the list of available commands and options, run `antctl help`. The list
will be different based on whether you are connecting to the Antrea Controller
or Agent.

When running out-of-cluster ("controller mode" only), antctl will look for your
kubeconfig file at `$HOME/.kube/config` by default. You can select a different
one by setting the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable or with `--kubeconfig`
(the latter taking precedence over the former).

The following sub-sections introduce a few commands which are useful for
troubleshooting the Antrea system.

### Showing or changing log verbosity level

Starting from version 0.10.0, Antrea supports showing or changing the log
verbosity level of Antrea Controller or Agent using the `antctl log-level`
command. The command can only run locally inside the `antrea-controller` or
`antrea-agent` container.

The following command prints the current log verbosity level:

```bash
antctl log-level
```

This command updates the log verbosity level (the `LEVEL` argument must be an
integer):

```bash
antctl log-level LEVEL
```

### Collecting support information

Starting with version 0.7.0, Antrea supports the `antctl supportbundle` command,
which can collect information from the cluster, the Antrea Controller and all
Antrea agents. This information is useful when trying to troubleshoot issues in
Kubernetes clusters using Antrea. In particular, when running the command
out-of-cluster, all the information can be collected under one single directory,
which you can upload and share when reporting issues on Github. Simply run the
command as follows:

```bash
antctl supportbundle [-d TARGET_DIR]
```

If you omit to provide a directory, antctl will create one in the current
working directory, using the current timestamp as a suffix. The command also
provides additional flags to filter the results: run `antctl supportbundle
--help` for the full list.

The collected support bundle will include the following (more information may be
included over time):

* cluster information: description of the different K8s resources in the cluster
  (Nodes, Deployments, etc.).
* Antrea Controller information: all the available logs (contents will vary
  based on the verbosity selected when running the controller) and state stored
  at the controller (e.g. computed NetworkPolicy objects).
* Antrea Agent information: all the available logs from the agent and the OVS
  daemons, network configuration of the Node (e.g. routes, iptables rules, OVS
  flows) and state stored at the agent (e.g. computed NetworkPolicy objects
  received from the controller).

**Be aware that the generated support bundle includes a lot of information,
  including logs, so please review the contents of the directory before sharing
  it on Github and ensure that you do not share anything sensitive.**

The `antctl supportbundle` command can also be run inside a Controller or Agent
Pod, in which case only local information will be collected.

### controllerinfo and agentinfo commands

`antctl` controller command `get controllerinfo` (or `get ci`) and agent command
`get agentinfo` (or `get ai`) print the runtime information of
`antrea-controller` and `antrea-agent` respectively.

```bash
antctl get controllerinfo
antctl get agentinfo
```

### NetworkPolicy commands

Both Antrea Controller and Agent support querying the NetworkPolicy objects in the Antrea
control plane API. The source of a control plane NetworkPolicy is the original policy resource
(K8s NetworkPolicy or Antrea-native Policy) from which the control plane NetworkPolicy was
derived.

- `antctl` `get networkpolicy` (or `get netpol`) command can print all
NetworkPolicies, a specified NetworkPolicy, or NetworkPolicies in a specified
Namespace.
- `get appliedtogroup` (or `get atg`) command can print all NetworkPolicy
AppliedToGroups (AppliedToGroup includes the Pods to which a NetworkPolicy is
applied), or a specified AppliedToGroup.
- `get addressgroup` (or `get ag`) command can print all NetworkPolicy
AddressGroups (AddressGroup defines source or destination addresses of
NetworkPolicy rules), or a specified AddressGroup.

Using the `json` or `yaml` antctl output format can print more information of
NetworkPolicy, AppliedToGroup, and AddressGroup, than using the default `table`
output format. The `NAME` of a control plane NetworkPolicy is the UID of its source
NetworkPolicy.

```bash
antctl get networkpolicy [NAME] [-n NAMESPACE] [-o yaml]
antctl get appliedtogroup [NAME] [-o yaml]
antctl get addressgroup [NAME] [-o yaml]
```

NetworkPolicy also supports `sort-by=effectivePriority` option, which can be used to
view the effective order in which the NetworkPolicies are evaluated. Antrea-native
NetworkPolicy ordering is documented [here](
antrea-network-policy.md#antrea-native-policy-ordering-based-on-priorities).

```bash
antctl get networkpolicy --sort-by=effectivePriority
```

Antrea Agent supports some extra `antctl` commands.

* Printing NetworkPolicies applied to a specific local Pod.

  ```bash
  antctl get networkpolicy -p POD -n NAMESPACE
  ```

* Printing NetworkPolicies with a specific source NetworkPolicy type.

  ```bash
  antctl get networkpolicy -T (K8sNP|ACNP|ANP)
  ```
  
* Printing NetworkPolicies with a specific source NetworkPolicy name.

  ```bash
  antctl get networkpolicy -S SOURCE_NAME [-n NAMESPACE]
  ```

#### Mapping endpoints to NetworkPolicies

`antctl` supports mapping a specific Pod to the NetworkPolicies which "select"
this Pod, either because they apply to the Pod directly or because one of their
policy rules selects the Pod.

```bash
antctl query endpoint -p POD [-n NAMESPACE]
```

If no Namespace is provided with `-n`, the command will default to the "default"
Namespace.

This command only works in "controller mode" and **as of now it can only be run
from inside the Antrea Controller Pod, and not from out-of-cluster**.

### Dumping Pod network interface information

`antctl` agent command `get podinterface` (or `get pi`) can dump network
interface information of all local Pods, or a specified local Pod, or local Pods
in the specified Namespace, or local Pods matching the specified Pod name.

```bash
antctl get podinterface [NAME] [-n NAMESPACE]
```

### Dumping OVS flows

Starting from version 0.6.0, Antrea Agent supports dumping Antrea OVS flows. The
`antctl` `get ovsflows` (or `get of`) command can dump all OVS flows, flows
added for a specified Pod, or flows added for Service load-balancing of a
specified Service, or flows added to realize a specified NetworkPolicy, or flows
in the specified OVS flow tables, or all or the specified OVS groups.

```bash
antctl get ovsflows
antctl get ovsflows -p POD -n NAMESPACE
antctl get ovsflows -S SERVICE -n NAMESPACE
antctl get ovsflows -N NETWORKPOLICY -n NAMESPACE
antctl get ovsflows -T TABLE_A,TABLE_B
antctl get ovsflows -T TABLE_A,TABLE_B_NUM
antctl get ovsflows -G all
antctl get ovsflows -G GROUP_ID1,GROUP_ID2
```

OVS flow tables can be specified using table names, or the table numbers.
`antctl get ovsflow --help` lists all Antrea flow tables. For more information
about Antrea OVS pipeline and flows, please refer to the [OVS pipeline doc](design/ovs-pipeline.md).

Example outputs of dumping Pod and NetworkPolicy OVS flows:

```bash

### OVS packet tracing

Starting from version 0.7.0, Antrea Agent supports tracing the OVS flows that a
specified packet traverses, leveraging the [OVS packet tracing tool](http://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/topics/tracing).

`antctl trace-packet` command starts a packet tracing operation.
`antctl help trace-packet` shows the usage of the command. This section lists a
few trace-packet command examples.

```bash
# Trace an IP packet between two Pods
antctl trace-packet -S ns1/pod1 -D ns2/pod2
# Trace a Service request from a local Pod
antctl trace-packet -S ns1/pod1 -D ns2/svc2 -f "tcp,tcp_dst=80"
# Trace the Service reply packet (assuming "ns2/pod2" is the Service backend Pod)
antctl trace-packet -D ns1/pod1 -S ns2/pod2 -f "tcp,tcp_src=80"
# Trace an IP packet from a Pod to gateway port
antctl trace-packet -S ns1/pod1 -D antrea-gw0
# Trace a UDP packet from a Pod to an IP address
antctl trace-packet -S ns1/pod1 -D 10.1.2.3 -f udp,udp_dst=1234
# Trace a UDP packet from an IP address to a Pod
antctl trace-packet -D ns1/pod1 -S 10.1.2.3 -f udp,udp_src=1234
# Trace an ARP request from a local Pod
antctl trace-packet -p ns1/pod1 -f arp,arp_spa=10.1.2.3,arp_sha=00:11:22:33:44:55,arp_tpa=10.1.2.1,dl_dst=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```

Example outputs of tracing a UDP (DNS request) packet from a remote Pod to a
local (coredns) Pod:

```bash
$ antctl trace-packet -S default/web-client -D kube-system/coredns-6955765f44-zcbwj -f udp,udp_dst=53

### Traceflow

`antctl traceflow` (or `antctl tf`) command is used to start a Traceflow and
retrieve its result. After the result is collected, the Traceflow will be
deleted. Users can also create a Traceflow with `kubectl`, but `antctl traceflow`
offers a simpler way. For more information about Traceflow, refer to the
[Traceflow guide](traceflow-guide.md).

To start a regular Traceflow, both `--source` (or `-S`) and `--destination` (or
`-D`) arguments must be specified, and the source must be a Pod. For example:

```bash
$ antctl tf -S busybox0 -D busybox1
name: busybox0-to-busybox1-fpllngzi
phase: Succeeded
source: default/busybox0
destination: default/busybox1
results:
- node: antrea-linux-testbed7-1
  timestamp: 1596435607
  observations:
  - component: SpoofGuard
    action: Forwarded
  - component: Forwarding
    componentInfo: Output
    action: Delivered
```

To start a live-traffic Traceflow, add the `--live-traffic` (or `-L`) flag. Add
the `--dropped-only` flag to indicate only the packet dropped by a NetworkPolicy
should be captured in the live-traffic Traceflow. A live-traffic Traceflow
just requires one of `--source` and `--destination` arguments to be specified,
and at least one of them must be a Pod.

The `--flow` (or `-f`) argument can be used to specify the Traceflow packet
headers with the [ovs-ofctl](http://www.openvswitch.org//support/dist-docs/ovs-ofctl.8.txt)
flow syntax. The supported flow fields include: IP family (`ipv6` to indicate an
IPv6 packet), IP protocol (`icmp`, `icmpv6`, `tcp`, `udp`), source and
destination ports (`tcp_src`, `tcp_dst`, `udp_src`, `udp_dst`), and TCP flags
(`tcp_flags`).

By default, the command will wait for the Traceflow to succeed or fail, or
timeout. The default timeout is 10 seconds, but can be changed with the
`--timeout` (or `-t`) argument. Add the `--no-wait` flag to start a Traceflow
without waiting for its results. In this case, the command will not delete the
Traceflow resource. The `traceflow` command supports yaml and json output.

More examples of `antctl traceflow`:

```bash
# Start a Traceflow from pod1 to pod2, both Pods are in Namespace default
$ antctl traceflow -S pod1 -D pod2
# Start a Traceflow from pod1 in Namepace ns1 to a destination IP
$ antctl traceflow -S ns1/pod1 -D 123.123.123.123
# Start a Traceflow from pod1 to Service svc1 in Namespace ns1
$ antctl traceflow -S pod1 -D ns1/svc1 -f tcp,tcp_dst=80
# Start a Traceflow from pod1 to pod2, with a UDP packet to destination port 1234
$ antctl traceflow -S pod1 -D pod2 -f udp,udp_dst=1234
# Start a Traceflow for live TCP traffic from pod1 to svc1, with 1 minute timeout
$ antctl traceflow -S pod1 -D svc1 -f tcp --live-traffic -t 1m
# Start a Traceflow to capture the first dropped TCP packet to pod1 on port 80, within 10 minutes
$ antctl traceflow -D pod1 -f tcp,tcp_dst=80 --live-traffic --dropped-only -t 10m
```

### Antctl Proxy

Antctl can run as a reverse proxy for the Antrea API (Controller or arbitrary
Agent). Usage is very similar to `kubectl proxy` and the implementation is
essentially the same.

To run a reverse proxy for the Antrea Controller API, use:

```bash
antctl proxy --controller
````

To run a reverse proxy for the Antrea Agent API for the antrea-agent Pod running
on Node <TARGET_NODE>, use:

```bash
antctl proxy --agent-node
```

You can then access the API at `127.0.0.1:8001`. To implement this
functionality, antctl retrieves the Node IP address and API server port for the
Antrea Controller or for the specified Agent from the K8s API, and it proxies
all the requests received on `127.0.0.1:8001` directly to that IP / port. One
thing to keep in mind is that the TLS connection between the proxy and the
Antrea Agent or Controller will not be secure (no certificate verification), and
the proxy should be used for debugging only.

To see the full list of supported options, run `antctl proxy --help`.

This feature is useful if one wants to use the Go
[pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/) tool to collect runtime
profiling data about the Antrea components. Please refer to this
[document](troubleshooting.md#profiling-antrea-components) for more information.
