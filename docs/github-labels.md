# GitHub Label List

We use GitHub labels to perform issue triage, track and report on development
progress, plan roadmaps, and automate issue grooming.

To ensure that contributing new issues and PRs remains straight-forward, we would
like to keep the labels required for submission to a minimum. The remaining
labels will be added either by automation or manual grooming by other
contributors and maintainers.

The labels in this list originated within Kubernetes at
https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/label_sync/labels.md.
