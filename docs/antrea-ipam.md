# Antrea IPAM Capabilities

## Running NodeIPAM within Antrea Controller

NodeIPAM is a Kubernetes component, which manages IP address pool allocation per
each Node, when the Node initializes.

On single stack deployments, NodeIPAM allocates a single IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR per
Node, while in dual stack deployments, NodeIPAM allocates two CIDRs per each
Node: one for each IP family.

NodeIPAM is configured with a CIDR per each family, which it slices into smaller
per-Node CIDRs. When a Node is initialized, the CIDRs are set to the podCIDRs
attribute of the Node spec.

Antrea NodeIPAM controller can be executed in scenarios where the
NodeIPAMController is disabled in kube-controller-manager.

Note that running Antrea NodeIPAM while NodeIPAMController runs within
kube-controller-manager would cause conflicts and result in an unstable
behavior.

### Configuration

Antrea Controller NodeIPAM configuration items are grouped under `nodeIPAM`
dictionary key.

NodeIPAM dictionary contains the following items:

- `enableNodeIPAM`: Enable the integrated NodeIPAM controller within the Antrea
controller. Default is false.

- `clusterCIDRs`: CIDR ranges for Pods in cluster. String array containing single
CIDR range, or multiple ranges. The CIDRs could be either IPv4 or IPv6. At most
one CIDR may be specified for each IP family. Example values:
`[172.100.0.0/16]`, `[172.100.0.0/20, fd00:172:100::/60]`.

- `serviceCIDR`: CIDR range for IPv4 Services in cluster. It is not necessary to
specify it when there is no overlap with clusterCIDRs.

- `serviceCIDRv6`: CIDR range for IPv6 Services in cluster. It is not necessary to
  specify it when there is no overlap with clusterCIDRs.

- `nodeCIDRMaskSizeIPv4`: Mask size for IPv4 Node CIDR in IPv4 or dual-stack
cluster. Valid range is 16 to 30. Default is 24.

- `nodeCIDRMaskSizeIPv6`: Mask size for IPv6 Node CIDR in IPv6 or dual-stack
cluster. Valid range is 64 to 126. Default is 64.
