## Overview

[Antrea](design/architecture.md) is a Kubernetes network plugin that provides network
connectivity and security features for Pod workloads. Considering the scale and
dynamism of Kubernetes workloads in a cluster, Network Flow Visibility helps in
the management and configuration of Kubernetes resources such as Network Policy,
Services, Pods etc., and thereby provides opportunities to enhance the performance
and security aspects of Pod workloads.

For visualizing the network flows, Antrea monitors the flows in Linux conntrack
module. These flows are converted to flow records, and then flow records are post-processed
before they are sent to the configured external flow collector. High-level design is given below:

![Antrea Flow Visibility Design](assets/flow_visibility.svg)

## Flow Exporter

In Antrea, the basic building block for the Network Flow Visibility is the **Flow
Exporter**. Flow Exporter operates within Antrea Agent; it builds and maintains
a connection store by polling and dumping flows from conntrack module periodically.
Connections from the connection store are exported to the [Flow Aggregator
Service](#flow-aggregator) using the IPFIX protocol, and for this purpose we use
the IPFIX exporter process from the [go-ipfix](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix)
library.

### Configuration

To enable the Flow Exporter feature at the Antrea Agent, the following config
parameters have to be set in the Antrea Agent ConfigMap:

```yaml
  antrea-agent.conf: |
    # FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
    featureGates:
    # Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
      FlowExporter: true

    # Provide the IPFIX collector address as a string with format <HOST>:[<PORT>][:<PROTO>].
    # HOST can either be the DNS name or the IP of the Flow Collector. For example,
    # "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc" can be provided as a DNS name to connect
    # to the Antrea Flow Aggregator Service. If IP, it can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
    # However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
    # If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.
    # If no PROTO is given, we consider "tls" as default. We support "tls", "tcp" and
    # "udp" protocols. "tls" is used for securing communication between flow exporter and
    # flow aggregator.
    #flowCollectorAddr: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc:4739:tls"
    
    # Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the
    # flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module. Flow poll interval
    # should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    #flowPollInterval: "5s"

    # Provide the active flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
    # record is sent to the collector for active flows. Thus, for flows with a continuous
    # stream of packets, a flow record will be exported to the collector once the elapsed
    # time since the last export event is equal to the value of this timeout.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    #activeFlowExportTimeout: "60s"

    # Provide the idle flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
    # record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no
    # packet matching this flow has been observed since the last export event.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    #idleFlowExportTimeout: "15s"
```

Please note that the default value for `flowCollectorAddr` is `"flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc:4739:tls"`,
which uses the DNS name of the Flow Aggregator Service, if the Service is deployed
with the Name and Namespace set to `flow-aggregator`. For Antrea Agent running on
a Windows node, the user is required to change the default value of `HOST` in `flowCollectorAddr`
from DNS name to the Cluster IP of the Flow Aggregator service. The reason is because
on Windows the Antrea Agent runs as a process, it uses the host's default DNS setting and the DNS
resolver will not be configured to talk to the CoreDNS Service for cluster local DNS queries like
`flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc`. In addition, if you deploy the Flow Aggregator Service
with a different Name and Namespace, then either use the appropriate DNS name or the Cluster IP of
the Service.

Please note that the default values for
`flowPollInterval`, `activeFlowExportTimeout`, and `idleFlowExportTimeout` parameters are set to 5s, 60s, and 15s, respectively.
TLS communication between the Flow Exporter and the Flow Aggregator is enabled by default.
Please modify them as per your requirements.

### IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) in a Flow Record

There are 34 IPFIX IEs in each exported flow record, which are defined in the
IANA-assigned IE registry, the Reverse IANA-assigned IE registry and the Antrea
IE registry. The reverse IEs are used to provide bi-directional information about
the flow. The Enterprise ID is 0 for IANA-assigned IE registry, 29305 for reverse
IANA IE registry, 56505 for Antrea IE registry. All the IEs used by the Antrea
Flow Exporter are listed below:

### Supported capabilities

#### Types of Flows and Associated Information

Currently, the Flow Exporter feature provides visibility for Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service
and Pod-to-External network flows along with the associated statistics such as data
throughput (bits per second), packet throughput (packets per second), cumulative byte
count and cumulative packet count. Pod-To-Service flow visibility is supported
only [when Antrea Proxy enabled](feature-gates.md), which is the case by default
starting with Antrea v0.11. In the future, we will enable the support for External-To-Service
flows.

Kubernetes information such as Node name, Pod name, Pod Namespace, Service name,
NetworkPolicy name and NetworkPolicy Namespace, is added to the flow records.
Network Policy Rule Action (Allow, Reject, Drop) is also supported for both
Antrea-native NetworkPolicies and K8s NetworkPolicies. For K8s NetworkPolicies,
connections dropped due to [isolated Pod behavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#isolated-and-non-isolated-pods)
will be assigned the Drop action.
For flow records that are exported from any given Antrea Agent, the Flow Exporter
only provides the information of Kubernetes entities that are local to the Antrea
Agent. In other words, flow records are only complete for intra-Node flows, but
incomplete for inter-Node flows. It is the responsibility of the [Flow Aggregator](#flow-aggregator)
to correlate flows from the source and destination Nodes and produce complete flow
records.

Both Flow Exporter and Flow Aggregator are supported in IPv4 clusters, IPv6 clusters and dual-stack clusters.

#### Connection Metrics

We support following connection metrics as Prometheus metrics that are exposed
through [Antrea Agent apiserver endpoint](prometheus-integration.md):
`antrea_agent_conntrack_total_connection_count`,
`antrea_agent_conntrack_antrea_connection_count`,
`antrea_agent_denied_connection_count`,
`antrea_agent_conntrack_max_connection_count`, and
`antrea_agent_flow_collector_reconnection_count`

## Flow Aggregator

Flow Aggregator is deployed as a Kubernetes Service. The main functionality of Flow
Aggregator is to store, correlate and aggregate the flow records received from the
Flow Exporter of Antrea Agents. More details on the functionality are provided in
the [Supported Capabilities](#supported-capabilities-1) section.

Flow Aggregator is implemented as IPFIX mediator, which
consists of IPFIX Collector Process, IPFIX Intermediate Process and IPFIX Exporter
Process. We use the [go-ipfix](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix) library to implement
the Flow Aggregator.

### Deployment

To deploy a released version of Flow Aggregator Service, pick a deployment manifest from the
[list of releases](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases). For any
given release `<TAG>` (e.g. `v0.12.0`), you can deploy Flow Aggregator as follows:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/flow-aggregator.yml
```

To deploy the latest version of Flow Aggregator Service (built from the main branch), use the
checked-in [deployment yaml](/build/yamls/flow-aggregator.yml):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/build/yamls/flow-aggregator.yml
```

### Configuration

The following configuration parameters have to be provided through the Flow
Aggregator ConfigMap. Flow aggregator needs to be configured with at least one
of the supported [Flow Collectors](#flow-collectors).
`flowCollector` is mandatory for [go-ipfix collector](#deployment-steps) or
[ELK flow collector](#deployment-steps-2), and `clickHouse` is mandatory for
[Grafana Flow Collector](#grafana-flow-collector). We provide an example value
for this parameter in the following snippet.  

* If you have deployed the [go-ipfix collector](#deployment-steps),
then please set `flowCollector.enable` to `true` and use the address for
`flowCollector.address`: `<Ipfix-Collector Cluster IP>:<port>:<tcp|udp>`
* If you have deployed the [ELK flow collector](#deployment-steps-2), then
please set `flowCollector.enable` to `true` and use the address for
`flowCollector.address`:`<Logstash Cluster IP>:4739:<tcp|udp>` for sending
IPFIX messages, or `<Logstash Cluster IP>:4736:<tcp|udp>` for sending JSON
format records. Record format is specified with `flowCollector.recordFormat`
(defaults to IPFIX) and must match the format expected by the collector.
* If you have deployed the [Grafana Flow Collector](#grafana-flow-collector),
then please enable the collector by setting `clickHouse.enable` to `true`. If
it is deployed following the [deployment steps](#deployment-steps-1), the
ClickHouse server is already exposed via a K8s Service, and no further
configuration is required. If a different FQDN or IP is desired, please use
the URL for `clickHouse.databaseURL` in the following format:
`tcp://<ClickHouse server FQDN or IP>:<ClickHouse TCP port>`.

```yaml
flow-aggregator.conf: |  
  # Provide the active flow record timeout as a duration string. This determines
  # how often the flow aggregator exports the active flow records to the flow
  # collector. Thus, for flows with a continuous stream of packets, a flow record
  # will be exported to the collector once the elapsed time since the last export
  # event in the flow aggregator is equal to the value of this timeout.
  # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  #activeFlowRecordTimeout: 60s

  # Provide the inactive flow record timeout as a duration string. This determines
  # how often the flow aggregator exports the inactive flow records to the flow
  # collector. A flow record is considered to be inactive if no matching record
  # has been received by the flow aggregator in the specified interval.
  # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  #inactiveFlowRecordTimeout: 90s
  
  # Provide the transport protocol for the flow aggregator collecting process, which is tls, tcp or udp.
  #aggregatorTransportProtocol: "tls"
  
  # Provide DNS name or IP address of flow aggregator for generating TLS certificate. It must match
  # the flowCollectorAddr parameter in the antrea-agent config.
  #flowAggregatorAddress: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc"

  # recordContents enables configuring some fields in the flow records. Fields can
  # be excluded to reduce record size, but some features or external tooling may
  # depend on these fields.
  recordContents:
    # Determine whether source and destination Pod labels will be included in the flow records.
    #podLabels: false

  # apiServer contains APIServer related configuration options.
  apiServer:
    # The port for the flow-aggregator APIServer to serve on.
    #apiPort: 10348

    # Comma-separated list of Cipher Suites. If omitted, the default Go Cipher Suites will be used.
    # https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants
    # Note that TLS1.3 Cipher Suites cannot be added to the list. But the apiserver will always
    # prefer TLS1.3 Cipher Suites whenever possible.
    #tlsCipherSuites:

    # TLS min version from: VersionTLS10, VersionTLS11, VersionTLS12, VersionTLS13.
    #tlsMinVersion:
  
  # flowCollector contains external IPFIX or JSON collector related configuration options.
  flowCollector:
    # Enable is the switch to enable exporting flow records to external flow collector.
    #enable: false
  
    # Provide the flow collector address as string with format <IP>:<port>[:<proto>], where proto is tcp or udp.
    # If no L4 transport proto is given, we consider tcp as default.
    address: "192.168.86.86:4739:tcp"
  
    # Provide the 32-bit Observation Domain ID which will uniquely identify this instance of the flow
    # aggregator to an external flow collector. If omitted, an Observation Domain ID will be generated
    # from the persistent cluster UUID generated by Antrea. Failing that (e.g. because the cluster UUID
    # is not available), a value will be randomly generated, which may vary across restarts of the flow
    # aggregator.
    #observationDomainID:
  
    # Provide format for records sent to the configured flow collector.
    # Supported formats are IPFIX and JSON.
    #recordFormat: "IPFIX"
  
  # clickHouse contains ClickHouse related configuration options.
  clickHouse:
    # Enable is the switch to enable exporting flow records to ClickHouse.
    #enable: false
  
    # Database is the name of database where Antrea "flows" table is created.
    #database: "default"
  
    # DatabaseURL is the url to the database. TCP protocol is required.
    #databaseURL: "tcp://clickhouse-clickhouse.flow-visibility.svc:9000"
  
    # Debug enables debug logs from ClickHouse sql driver.
    #debug: false
  
    # Compress enables lz4 compression when committing flow records.
    #compress: true
  
    # CommitInterval is the periodical interval between batch commit of flow records to DB.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    # The minimum interval is 1s based on ClickHouse documentation for best performance.
    #commitInterval: "8s"
```

Please note that the default values for `activeFlowRecordTimeout`,
`inactiveFlowRecordTimeout`, `aggregatorTransportProtocol`, and
`flowAggregatorAddress` parameters are set to `60s`, `90s`, `tls` and
`flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc`, respectively. Please make sure that
`aggregatorTransportProtocol` and protocol of `flowCollectorAddr` in
`agent-agent.conf` are set to `tls` to guarantee secure communication works
properly. Protocol of `flowCollectorAddr` and `aggregatorTransportProtocol`
must always match, so TLS must either be enabled for both sides or disabled
for both sides. Please modify the parameters as per your requirements.

Please note that the default value for `recordContents.podLabels` is `false`,
which indicates source and destination Pod labels will not be included in the
flow records exported to `flowCollector` and `clickHouse`. If you would like
to include them, you can modify the value to `true`.

Please note that the default value for `apiServer.apiPort` is `10348`, which
is the port used to expose the Flow Aggregator's APIServer. Please modify the
parameters as per your requirements.

Please note that the default value for `clickHouse.commitInterval` is `8s`,
which is based on experiment results to achieve best ClickHouse write
performance and data retention. Based on ClickHouse recommendation for best
performance, this interval is required be no shorter than `1s`. Also note
that flow aggregator has a cache limit of ~500k records for ClickHouse-Grafana
collector. If `clickHouse.commitInterval` is set to a value too large, there's
a risk of losing records.

### IPFIX Information Elements (IEs) in an Aggregated Flow Record

In addition to IPFIX information elements provided in the [above section](#ipfix-information-elements-ies-in-a-flow-record),
the Flow Aggregator adds the following fields to the flow records.

### Supported capabilities

#### Storage of Flow Records

Flow Aggregator stores the received flow records from Antrea Agents in a hash map,
where the flow key is 5-tuple of a network connection. 5-tuple consists of Source IP,
Destination IP, Source Port, Destination Port and Transport protocol. Therefore,
Flow Aggregator maintains one flow record for any given connection, and this flow
record gets updated till the connection in the Kubernetes cluster becomes invalid.

#### Correlation of Flow Records

In the case of inter-Node flows, there are two flow records, one
from the source Node, where the flow originates from, and another one from the destination
Node, where the destination Pod resides. Both the flow records contain incomplete
information as mentioned [here](#types-of-flows-and-associated-information). Flow
Aggregator provides support for the correlation of the flow records from the
source Node and the destination Node, and it exports a single flow record with complete
information for both inter-Node and intra-Node flows.

#### Aggregation of Flow Records

Flow Aggregator aggregates the flow records that belong to a single connection.
As part of aggregation, fields such as flow timestamps, flow statistics etc. are
updated. For the purpose of updating flow statistics fields, Flow Aggregator introduces
the [new fields](#ies-from-antrea-ie-registry) in Antrea Enterprise IPFIX registry
corresponding to the Source Node and Destination Node, so that flow statistics from
different Nodes can be preserved.

### Antctl support

antctl can access the Flow Aggregator API to dump flow records and print metrics
about flow record processing. Refer to the
[antctl documentation](antctl.md#flow-aggregator-commands) for more information.

## Quick deployment

If you would like to quickly try Network Flow Visibility feature, you can deploy
Antrea, the Flow Aggregator Service and the ELK Flow Collector on the
[Vagrant setup](../test/e2e/README.md). You can use the following command:

```shell
./infra/vagrant/provision.sh
./infra/vagrant/push_antrea.sh --flow-collector ELK
```

If you would like to deploy elastic search with high resources, you can change
the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` in the [ELK Flow Collector configuration](../build/yamls/elk-flow-collector/elk-flow-collector.yml)
according to the [guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.8/heap-size.html).
A larger heap size, like `-Xms1g -Xmx2g`, requires the Vagrant Nodes to have
higher memory than default. In this case, we need to provision the Nodes with
the `--large` option as with the following command:

```shell
./infra/vagrant/provision.sh --large
./infra/vagrant/push_antrea.sh --flow-collector ELK
```

Alternatively, given any external IPFIX flow collector, you can deploy Antrea and
the Flow Aggregator Service on a default Vagrant setup by running the following
commands:

```shell
./infra/vagrant/provision.sh
./infra/vagrant/push_antrea.sh --flow-collector <externalFlowCollectorAddress>
```

## Flow Collectors

Here we list three choices the external configured flow collector: go-ipfix collector,
Grafana flow collector and ELK flow collector. For each collector, we introduce how to
deploy it and how to output or visualize the collected flow records information.

### Go-ipfix Collector

#### Deployment Steps

The go-ipfix collector can be built from [go-ipfix library](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix).
It is used to collect, decode and log the IPFIX records.

* To deploy a released version of the go-ipfix collector, please choose one
deployment manifest from the list of releases (supported after v0.5.2).
For any given release <TAG> (e.g. v0.5.2), you can deploy the collector as follows:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix/releases/download/<TAG>/ipfix-collector.yaml
```

* To deploy the latest version of the go-ipfix collector (built from the main branch),
use the checked-in [deployment manifest](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix/blob/main/build/yamls/ipfix-collector.yaml):

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/go-ipfix/main/build/yamls/ipfix-collector.yaml
```

Go-ipfix collector also supports customization on its parameters: port and protocol.
Please follow the [go-ipfix documentation](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix#readme)
to configure those parameters if needed.

#### Output Flow Records

To output the flow records collected by the go-ipfix collector, use the command below:

```shell
kubectl logs <ipfix-collector-pod-name> -n ipfix
```

### Grafana Flow Collector

Grafana Flow Collector feature is only available for releases starting from Antrea v1.6.

#### Purpose

Antrea supports sending IPFIX flow records through the Flow Exporter and Flow Aggregator
feature described above. The Grafana Flow Collector works as the visualization tool
for flow records and flow-related information. We use ClickHouse as the data storage,
which collects flow records data from the Flow Aggregator and load the data to Grafana.
This document provides the guidelines for deploying the Grafana Flow Collector
with support for Antrea-specific IPFIX fields in a Kubernetes cluster.

#### About Grafana and ClickHouse

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) is an open-source platform for monitoring
and observability. Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand
your metrics. [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/) is an open-source, high performance
columnar OLAP database management system for real-time analytics using SQL. We use
ClickHouse as the data storage, and use Grafana as the data visualization and monitoring tool.

#### Deployment Steps

To deploy the Grafana Flow Collector, the first step is to install the ClickHouse
Operator, which creates, configures and manages ClickHouse clusters. Check the [homepage](https://github.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator)
for more information about the ClickHouse Operator. Running the following command
will install ClickHouse Operator into `kube-system` Namespace.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/master/deploy/operator/clickhouse-operator-install-bundle.yaml
```

To deploy a released version of the Grafana Flow Collector, find a deployment manifest
from the [list of releases](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases).
For any given release <TAG> (v1.6.0 or later version), run the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/flow-visibility.yml
```

To deploy the latest version of the Grafana Flow Collector (built from the main branch),
use the checked-in [deployment yaml](/build/yamls/flow-visibility.yml):

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/build/yamls/flow-visibility.yml
```

Please refer to the [Flow Aggregator Configuration](#configuration-1) to learn about
the ClickHouse configuration options.

Run the following command to check if ClickHouse and Grafana are deployed properly:

```bash
kubectl get all -n flow-visibility                                                               
```

The expected results will be like:

```bash

```

Run the following commands to print the IP of the workder Node and the NodePort
that Grafana is listening on:

```bash
NODE_NAME=$(kubectl get pod -l app=grafana -n flow-visibility -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.nodeName}')
NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes ${NODE_NAME} -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].address}')
GRAFANA_NODEPORT=$(kubectl get svc grafana -n flow-visibility -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[*].nodePort}')
echo "=== Grafana Service is listening on ${NODE_IP}:${GRAFANA_NODEPORT} ==="
```

You can now open the Grafana dashboard in the browser using `http://[NodeIP]:[NodePort]`.
You should be able to see a Grafana login page. Login credentials:

- username: admin
- password: admin

To stop the Grafana Flow Collector, run the following commands:

```shell
kubectl delete -f flow-visibility.yml
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altinity/clickhouse-operator/master/deploy/operator/clickhouse-operator-install-bundle.yaml -n kube-system
```

##### Credentials Configuration

ClickHouse credentials are specified in [clickhouse.yml][clickhouse_manifest_yaml] as
a resource of kind: a Secret. If the username `clickhouse_operator` has changed, please
update the following section accordingly.

```yaml
apiVersion: "clickhouse.altinity.com/v1"
kind: "ClickHouseInstallation"
metadata:
  name: clickhouse
  labels:
    app: clickhouse
spec:
  configuration:
    users:
      # replace clickhouse_operator by [new_username]
      clickhouse_operator/k8s_secret_password: flow-visibility/clickhouse-secret/password
      clickhouse_operator/networks/ip: "::/0"
```

ClickHouse credentials are also specified in [flow-aggregator.yml][flow_aggregator_manifest_yaml]
as a resource of kind: a Secret. Please also make the corresponding changes.

Grafana login credentials are specified in [grafana.yml][grafana_manifest_yaml] as
resource of kind: a Secret.

We recommend changing all the credentials above if you are going to run the Flow Collector
in production. After making any credentials change, run the following command to generate
a new manifest:

```shell
make manifest
```

##### ClickHouse Performance Configuration

The ClickHouse throughput depends on two factors - the storage size of the ClickHouse
and the time interval between the batch commits to the ClickHouse. Larger storage
size and longer commit interval provide higher throughput.

Grafana flow collector supports the ClickHouse in-memory deployment with limited
storage size. This is specified in [clickhouse.yml][clickhouse_manifest_yaml].
The default value of storage size for the ClickHouse server is 8 GiB. Users
can expect a linear growth in the ClickHouse throughput when they enlarge the
storage size. For development or testing environment, you can decrease the storage
size to 2GB. To deploy the ClickHouse with a different storage size, please
modify the `sizeLimit` in the following section.

```yaml
- name: clickhouse-storage-volume
  emptyDir:
    medium: Memory
    sizeLimit: 8Gi
```

After making the change, run the following command to generate a new manifest:

```shell
./hack/generate-manifest-flow-visibility.sh > build/yamls/flow-visibility.yml
```

The time interval between the batch commits to the ClickHouse is specified in the
[Flow Aggregator Configuration](#configuration-1) as `commitInterval`. The
ClickHouse throughput grows sightly when the commit interval grows from 1s to 8s.
A commit interval larger than 8s provides little improvement on the throughput.

#### Pre-built Dashboards

The following dashboards are pre-built and are recommended for Antrea flow
visualization. They can be found in the Home page of Grafana, by clicking
the Magnifier button on the left menu bar.

#### Dashboards Customization

If you would like to make any changes to any of the pre-built dashboards, or build
a new dashboard, please follow this [doc](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/export-import/)
for dashboard export and import. To generate a deployment manifest with the changes,
please follow the following steps:

1. Clone the repository. Exported dashboard JSON files should be placed under `antrea/build/yamls/flow-visibility/base/provisioning/dashboards`.
1. If a new dashboard is added, edit [kustomization.yml][flow_visibility_kustomization_yaml]
by adding the file in the following section:

    ```yaml
    - name: grafana-dashboard-config
      files:
      - provisioning/dashboards/flow_records_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/pod_to_pod_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/pod_to_service_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/pod_to_external_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/node_to_node_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/networkpolicy_allow_dashboard.json
      - provisioning/dashboards/[new_dashboard_name].json
    ```

1. Generate the new YAML manifest by running:

```bash
./hack/generate-manifest-flow-visibility.sh > build/yamls/flow-visibility.yml
```

### ELK Flow Collector (deprecated)

#### Purpose

Antrea supports sending IPFIX flow records through the Flow Exporter feature
described above. The Elastic Stack (ELK Stack) works as the data collector, data
storage and visualization tool for flow records and flow-related information. This
document provides the guidelines for deploying Elastic Stack with support for
Antrea-specific IPFIX fields in a Kubernetes cluster.

#### About Elastic Stack

[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co) is a group of open source products to
help collect, store, search, analyze and visualize data in real time. We will
use Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana in Antrea flow visualization.
[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) works as data collector to
centralize flow records. [Logstash Netflow codec plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-netflow.html)
supports Netflow v5/v9/v10(IPFIX) protocols for flow data collection.
The flow exporter feature in Antrea Agent uses the IPFIX (Netflow v10) protocol
to export flow records.

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), as a RESTful search
engine, supports storing, searching and indexing records received.
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) is mainly for data visualization and
exploration.

#### Deployment Steps

If you are looking for steps to deploy the ELK flow collector along with a new Antrea
cluster and the Flow Aggregator Service, then please refer to the
[quick deployment](#quick-deployment) section.

The following steps will deploy the ELK flow collector on an existing Kubernetes
cluster, which uses Antrea as the CNI. First step is to fetch the necessary resources
from the Antrea repository. You can either clone the entire repo or download the
particular folder using the subversion(svn) utility. If the deployed version of
Antrea has a release `<TAG>` (e.g. `v0.10.0`), then you can use the following command:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch <TAG> https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea.git && cd antrea/build/yamls/
or
svn export https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/tags/<TAG>/build/yamls/elk-flow-collector/
```

If the deployed version of Antrea is the latest version, i.e., built from the main
branch, then you can use the following command:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea.git && cd antrea/build/yamls/
or
svn export https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/trunk/build/yamls/elk-flow-collector/
```

To create the required K8s resources in the `elk-flow-collector` folder and get
everything up-and-running, run following commands:

```shell
kubectl create namespace elk-flow-collector
kubectl create configmap logstash-configmap -n elk-flow-collector --from-file=./elk-flow-collector/logstash/
kubectl apply -f ./elk-flow-collector/elk-flow-collector.yml -n elk-flow-collector
```

Please refer to the [Flow Aggregator Configuration](#configuration-1) to configure
external flow collector as Logstash Service Cluster IP.

Kibana dashboard is exposed as a Nodeport Service, which can be accessed via
`http://[NodeIP]: 30007`. `elk-flow-collector/kibana.ndjson` is an auto-generated
reusable file containing pre-built objects for visualizing Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service
and Node-to-Node flow records. To import the dashboards into Kibana, go to
**Management -> Saved Objects** and import `elk-flow-collector/kibana.ndjson`.

#### Pre-built Dashboards

The following dashboards are pre-built and are recommended for Antrea flow
visualization.

##### Network Policy

Network Policy dashboard provides filters over ingress network policy name and namespace, egress
network policy name and namespace to view corresponding flow throughput under network policy. Flows
are grouped by egress network policies (source) and ingress network policies (destination) in the
sankey diagram. When hovering over the flow, it will show corresponding Pod-to-Pod traffic details
and network policies.
