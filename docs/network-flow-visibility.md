## Overview
[Antrea](architecture.md) is a Kubernetes network plugin that provides network connectivity and security features for Pod workloads.
Considering the scale and dynamism of Kubernetes workloads in a cluster, Network Flow Visibility helps in the management
and configuration of Kubernetes resources such as Network Policy, Services, Pods etc., and thereby provides opportunities
to enhance the performance and security aspects of Pod workloads.

For visualizing the network flows, Antrea monitors the flows in Linux conntrack module. These flows are converted to flow records
and are sent to the configured flow controller. High-level design is given below:

## Flow Exporter feature

In Antrea, the basic building block for the Network Flow Visibility is the **Flow Exporter feature**. Flow Exporter operates
within Antrea Agent; it builds and maintains a connection store by polling and dumping flows from conntrack module periodically.
Connections from the connection store are exported to a flow collector using the IPFIX protocol, and for this purpose we
use the [go-ipfix](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix) library.
 
### Configuration

To enable the Flow Exporter feature at the Antrea Agent, the following config parameters have to be set in the Antrea Agent
ConfigMap as shown below. We provide some examples for the parameter values in the following snippet.

```yaml
  antrea-agent.conf: |
    # FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
    featureGates:
    # Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
      FlowExporter: true
    # Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster services in antrea agent.
    # It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
    # Service traffic.
      AntreaProxy: true

    # Provide flow collector address as string with format <IP>:<port>[:<proto>], where proto is tcp or udp. This also enables
    # the flow exporter that sends IPFIX flow records of conntrack flows on OVS bridge. If no L4 transport proto is given,
    # we consider tcp as default.
    flowCollectorAddr: "192.168.86.86:4739:tcp"

    # Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module.
    # Flow poll interval should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    flowPollInterval: "1s"

    # Provide flow export frequency, which is the number of poll cycles elapsed before flow exporter exports flow records to
    # the flow collector.
    # Flow export frequency should be greater than or equal to 1.
    flowExportFrequency: 5
```
 
Please note that the default values for `flowPollInterval` and `flowExportFrequency` parameters are set to 5s and 12, respectively.
`flowCollectorAddr` is a required parameter that is necessary for the Flow Exporter feature to work.

### Supported capabilities

Currently, the Flow Exporter feature provides visibility for Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Node, Node-to-Pod, Node-to-Node and Pod-to-Service
network flows along with the associated statistics such as data throughput (bits per second), packet throughput (packets
per second), cumulative byte count, cumulative packet count etc. Pod-To-Service flow visibility is supported only [when Antrea Proxy enabled](feature-gates.md). 

Kubernetes information such as Node name, Pod name, Pod Namespace, Service name etc. is added to the flow records.
For flow records that are exported from any given Antrea Agent, we only provide the information of Kubernetes entities
that are local to the Antrea Agent. In the future, we plan to extend this feature to provide information about remote
Kubernetes entities such as remote Node name, remote Pod name etc.

Please note that in the case of inter-Node flows, we are exporting only one copy of the flow record from the source Node,
where the flow is originated from, and ignore the flow record from the destination Node, where the destination Pod resides.
In the future, this behavior will be changed when the support for Network Policy is added as both hosts may apply different
Network Policies and Rules.

## ELK Flow Collector

### Purpose
Antrea supports sending IPFIX flow records through the Flow Exporter feature described above. The Elastic
Stack (ELK Stack) works as the data collector, data storage and visualization tool
for flow records and flow-related information. This document provides the guidelines for
deploying Elastic Stack with support for Antrea-specific IPFIX fields in a Kubernetes
cluster.

### About Elastic Stack
[Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co) is a group of open source products to
help collect, store, search, analyze and visualize data in real time. We will
use Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana in Antrea flow visualization.
[Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) works as data collector to
centralize flow records. [Logstash Netflow codec plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-codecs-netflow.html)
supports Netflow v5/v9/v10(IPFIX) protocols for flow data collection.
The flow exporter feature in Antrea Agent uses the IPFIX (Netflow v10) protocol 
to export flow records.

Exported IPFIX flow records contain the following Antrea-specific fields along 
with standard IANA fields.

| IPFIX Information Element | Enterprise ID | Field ID | Type        |
|---------------------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| sourcePodNamespace        | 55829         | 100      | string      |
| sourcePodName             | 55829         | 101      | string      |
| destinationPodNamespace   | 55829         | 102      | string      |
| destinationPodName        | 55829         | 103      | string      |
| sourceNodeName            | 55829         | 104      | string      |
| destinationNodeName       | 55829         | 105      | string      |
| destinationClusterIP      | 55829         | 106      | ipv4Address |
| destinationServicePortName| 55829         | 108      | string      |

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/), as a RESTful search
engine, supports storing, searching and indexing records received. 
[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) is mainly for data visualization and
exploration.

### Deployment Steps
To create all the necessary resources in the `elk-flow-collector` Namespace
and get everything up-and-running, run:

```shell
kubectl create namespace elk-flow-collector
kubectl create configmap logstash-configmap -n elk-flow-collector --from-file=build/yamls/elk-flow-collector/logstash/
kubectl apply -f build/yamls/elk-flow-collector/elk-flow-collector.yml -n elk-flow-collector
```

Kibana dashboard is exposed as a Nodeport Service, which can be accessed via
`http://[NodeIP]: 30007`

`build/yamls/flow/kibana.ndjson` is an auto-generated reusable file containing 
pre-built objects for visualizing Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service and Node-to-Node 
flow records. To import the dashboards into Kibana, go to 
**Management -> Saved Objects** and import `build/yamls/flow/kibana.ndjson`.
