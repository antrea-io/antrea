## Overview

Antrea supports Windows worker Node. On Windows Node, Antrea sets up an overlay
network to forward packets between Nodes and implements NetworkPolicies. Currently
Geneve, VXLAN, and STT tunnels are supported.

This page shows how to install antrea-agent on Windows Nodes and register the
Node to an existing Kubernetes cluster.

For the detailed design of how antrea-agent works on Windows, please refer to
the [design doc](design/windows-design.md).

### Components that run on Windows

The following components should be configured and run on the Windows Node.

* [kubernetes components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/user-guide-windows-nodes/)
* OVS daemons
* antrea-agent
* kube-proxy

antrea-agent and kube-proxy run as processes on host and are managed by
management Pods. It is recommended to run OVS daemons as Windows services.
We also support running OVS processes inside a container. If you don't want to
run antrea-agent and kube-proxy from the management Pods Antrea also provides
scripts which help to install and run these two components directly without Pod.
Please see [Manually run kube-proxy and antrea-agent on Windows worker Nodes](#Manually-run-kube-proxy-and-antrea-agent-on-Windows-worker-Nodes)
section for details.

### Antrea Windows demo

Watch this [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjeVPGgaNFU) of running
Antrea in a Kubernetes cluster with both Linux and Windows Nodes. The demo also
shows the Antrea OVS bridge configuration on a Windows Node, and NetworkPolicy
enforcement for Windows Pods. Note, OVS driver and daemons are pre-installed on
the Windows Nodes in the demo.

## Deploying Antrea on Windows Worker Node

### Prerequisites

* Obtain a Windows Server 2019 license (or higher) in order to configure the
  Windows Node that hosts Windows containers. And install the latest Windows
  updates.
* Deploy a Linux-based Kubernetes cluster.
* Install [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/install-the-hyper-v-role-on-windows-server)
  with management tools. If your Nodes do not have the virtualization
  capabilities required by Hyper-V, you could try the workaround
  described in the [Known issues](#Known-issues) section.
* Install [Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=Windows-Server).
* [Install OVS](http://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/intro/install/windows/)
  and configure the daemons as Windows service.
  - The kernel driver of OVS should be [signed by Windows Hardware Dev Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-signing).
  - If OVS driver is not signed, please refer to the Windows doc about how to
    [install a test-signed driver package on the test computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/installing-a-test-signed-driver-package-on-the-test-computer).
  - If you don't have a self-signed OVS package and just want to try the
    Antrea on Windows, Antrea provides a test-signed OVS package for you.
    See details in [Join Windows worker Nodes](#Join-Windows-worker-nodes)
    section.
* Some manifests are from [sig-windows-tool](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-windows-tools)
  repo. Release version v0.1.5 has been verified.

### Installation as a Service (containerd based runtimes)

First install Antrea (v0.13.0+ is required for containerd). The following
command deploys Antrea with the version specified by `<TAG>`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea.yml
```

Then, you can run the following commands. [nssm](https://nssm.cc/) will install
Antrea as a Windows service. Please ensure `nssm` is on your machine, which is
a handy tool to manage services on Windows. NOTE: `<KubernetesVersion>`,
`<KubeconfigPath>` and `<KubeletKubeconfigPath>` should be set by you.
`<KubeProxyKubeconfigPath>` is an optional parameter that is specific to
kube-proxy mode. E.g.

```powershell
$InstallKubeProxy=$false # Only for kube-proxy mode
$KubernetesVersion="v1.23.5"
$KubeConfig="C:/Users/Administrator/.kube/config" # admin kubeconfig
$KubeletKubeconfigPath="C:/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf"
if ($InstallKubeProxy) { $KubeProxyKubeconfigPath="C:/Users/Administrator/kubeproxy.conf" }
```

```powershell
$TAG="v1.13.0"
$KubernetesVersion="<KubernetesVersion>"
$KubeConfig="<KubeconfigPath>"
$KubeletKubeconfigPath="<KubeletKubeconfigPath>"
if ($InstallKubeProxy) { $KubeProxyKubeconfigPath="<KubeProxyKubeconfigPath>" }
$KubernetesHome="c:/k"
$AntreaHome="c:/k/antrea"
$KubeProxyLogPath="c:/var/log/kube-proxy"

curl.exe -LO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/${TAG}/hack/windows/Helper.psm1"
Import-Module ./Helper.psm1

Install-AntreaAgent -KubernetesVersion "$KubernetesVersion" -KubernetesHome "$KubernetesHome" -KubeConfig "$KubeConfig" -AntreaVersion "$TAG" -AntreaHome "$AntreaHome"
New-KubeProxyServiceInterface

New-DirectoryIfNotExist "${AntreaHome}/logs"
New-DirectoryIfNotExist "${KubeProxyLogPath}"
# Install kube-proxy service
if ($InstallKubeProxy) { nssm install kube-proxy "${KubernetesHome}/kube-proxy.exe" "--proxy-mode=userspace --kubeconfig=${KubeProxyKubeconfigPath} --log-dir=${KubeProxyLogPath} --logtostderr=false --alsologtostderr" }
nssm install antrea-agent "${AntreaHome}/bin/antrea-agent.exe" "--config=${AntreaHome}/etc/antrea-agent.conf --logtostderr=false --log_dir=${AntreaHome}/logs --alsologtostderr --log_file_max_size=100 --log_file_max_num=4"

nssm set antrea-agent DependOnService ovs-vswitchd
if ($InstallKubeProxy) { nssm set antrea-agent DependOnService kube-proxy ovs-vswitchd }
nssm set antrea-agent Start SERVICE_DELAYED_AUTO_START

if ($InstallKubeProxy) { Start-Service kube-proxy }
Start-Service antrea-agent
```

### Installation as a Pod (Docker/containerd based runtimes)

Starting with Antrea v1.13, Antrea will take over all the responsibilities of
kube-proxy for Windows nodes by default. Since Kubernetes 1.26, kube-proxy
should not be deployed on Windows Nodes with Antrea, as kube-proxy userspace
mode is deprecated. For Kubernetes versions prior to 1.26, Antrea can work
with userspace kube-proxy on Windows Nodes.
For more information refer to section [Add Windows kube-proxy DaemonSet (only for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.26)](#add-windows-kube-proxy-daemonset-only-for-kubernetes-versions-prior-to-126)

Installing Antrea using [wins](https://github.com/rancher/wins) gives you a lot
of flexibility to manage it as a Pod if you are using Docker on Windows, this is
how you can run Antrea in a Pod.

#### Download & Configure Antrea for Linux

Deploy Antrea for Linux on the control-plane Node following [Getting started](getting-started.md)
document. The following command deploys Antrea with the version specified by `<TAG>`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea.yml
```

#### Add Windows antrea-agent DaemonSet

Starting from Antrea 1.13, you need to manually set the `kubeAPIServerOverride`
field in the YAML configuration file as the Antrea Proxy `proxyAll` mode is
enabled by default.

```yaml
    # Provide the address of Kubernetes apiserver, to override any value provided in kubeconfig or InClusterConfig.
    # Defaults to "". It must be a host string, a host:port pair, or a URL to the base of the apiserver.
    kubeAPIServerOverride: "10.10.1.1:6443"

    # Option antreaProxy contains AntreaProxy related configuration options.
    antreaProxy:
      # ProxyAll tells antrea-agent to proxy ClusterIP Service traffic, regardless of where they come from.
      # Therefore, running kube-proxy is no longer required. This requires the AntreaProxy feature to be enabled.
      # Note that this option is experimental. If kube-proxy is removed, option kubeAPIServerOverride must be used to access
      # apiserver directly.
      proxyAll: true
```

An example command that downloads the antrea-agent manifest, sets
kubeAPIServerOverride, and deploys the antrea-agent DaemonSet with Docker
runtime is like below:

```bash
KUBE_APISERVER=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}') && \
curl -sL https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea-windows.yml | \
sed "s|.*kubeAPIServerOverride: \"\"|    kubeAPIServerOverride: \"${KUBE_APISERVER}\"|g" | \
kubectl apply -f -
```

Since Antrea 1.10, you can also deploy antrea-agent Windows DaemonSet with
containerd runtime by applying file `antrea-windows-containerd.yml`. The
following commands downloads the antrea-agent manifest, sets
kubeAPIServerOverride, and deploys the antrea-agent DaemonSet with containerd
runtime:

```bash
KUBE_APISERVER=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}') && \
curl -sL https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea-windows-containerd.yml | \
sed "s|.*kubeAPIServerOverride: \"\"|    kubeAPIServerOverride: \"${KUBE_APISERVER}\"|g" | \
kubectl apply -f -
```

Since Antrea 1.13, you can deploy both antrea-agent and antrea-ovs Windows DaemonSets
with containerd runtime by applying file `antrea-windows-containerd-with-ovs.yml`. The
following commands download the manifest, set kubeAPIServerOverride, and deploy
the antrea-agent and antrea-ovs Windows DaemonSets with containerd runtime:

```bash
KUBE_APISERVER=$(kubectl config view -o jsonpath='{.clusters[0].cluster.server}') && \
curl -sL https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/antrea-windows-containerd-with-ovs.yml | \
sed "s|.*kubeAPIServerOverride: \"\"|    kubeAPIServerOverride: \"${KUBE_APISERVER}\"|g" | \
kubectl apply -f -
```

#### Join Windows worker Nodes

##### 1. (Optional) Install OVS (provided by Antrea or your own)

Antrea supports running OVS on Windows as native services or inside a
host-process container. If you have an OVS package with a signed kernel
driver and want to run OVS inside container, you can skip this step.

Antrea provides a pre-built OVS package which contains test-signed OVS kernel
driver. If you don't have a self-signed OVS package and just want to try the
Antrea on Windows, this package can be used for testing. We also provide a helper
script `Install-OVS.ps1` to install the OVS driver and register userspace binaries
as services.

If you want to containerize OVS with an unsigned kernel driver, you must
pre-install the driver on the worker node before joining cluster. Hence,
you need to run the `Install-OVS.ps1` script to install only the driver like this:

```powershell
.\Install-OVS.ps1 -InstallUserspace $false
```

If you want to run OVS as Windows native services, you can run the script like this,

```powershell
Install-OVS.ps1 -ImportCertificate $false -Local -LocalFile <PathToOVSPackage>
```

**[Test-only]** First, if you are using test-signed driver (such as the one provided with Antrea),
please make sure to [enable test-signed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/the-testsigning-boot-configuration-option)

```powershell
Bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON
Restart-Computer
```

Then, install the OVS using the script.

```powershell
curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/hack/windows/Install-OVS.ps1
.\Install-OVS.ps1 # Test-only
.\Install-OVS.ps1 -ImportCertificate $false -Local -LocalFile <PathToOVSPackage> # Production
```

Verify the OVS services are installed.

```powershell
get-service ovsdb-server
get-service ovs-vswitchd
```

##### 2. Disable Windows Firewall

```powershell
Set-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain,Public,Private -Enabled False
```

##### 3. Install wins, kubelet, kubeadm and configure kubelet startup params

Firstly, install wins, kubelet, kubeadm using script `PrepareNode.ps1` provided
by kubernetes. The third component [`wins`](https://github.com/rancher/wins) is
used to run kube-proxy and antrea-agent on Windows host inside the Windows
container. Specify the Node IP, Kubernetes Version and container runtime while
running the script. If you do not specify any container runtime, it will be
containerd by default. The following command downloads and executes `Prepare-Node.ps1`:

```powershell
# Example:
curl.exe -LO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/hack/windows/Prepare-Node.ps1"
.\Prepare-Node.ps1 -KubernetesVersion v1.27.0 -NodeIP 192.168.1.10 

```

You can specify the ContainerRuntime parameter as docker if you want to run kubelet
using docker runtime on the node. (Note: Docker has been deprecated since k8s version 1.24).

```powershell
# Example:
curl.exe -LO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/hack/windows/Prepare-Node.ps1"
.\Prepare-Node.ps1 -KubernetesVersion v1.23.5 -NodeIP 192.168.1.10 -ContainerRuntime
docker

```

You can specify the InstallKubeProxy parameter as true if you want to install
kube-proxy on the node. The default value of the parameter is false. (Note: since
k8s version 1.26 kube-proxy kernel datapath has been deprecated on windows and antrea
can only run with proxyAll enabled)

```powershell

.\Prepare-Node.ps1 -KubernetesVersion v1.25.0 -InstallKubeProxy:$true -NodeIP 192.168.1.10

```

##### 4. Prepare Node environment needed by antrea-agent

Run the following commands to prepare the Node environment needed by antrea-agent:

```powershell
mkdir c:\k\antrea
cd c:\k\antrea
$TAG="v1.13.0"
curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/${TAG}/hack/windows/Clean-AntreaNetwork.ps1
curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/${TAG}/hack/windows/Prepare-ServiceInterface.ps1
curl.exe -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/${TAG}/hack/windows/Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1
.\Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1
```

The script `Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1` performs following tasks:

* Prepare network adapter for kube-proxy (for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.26).

    kube-proxy needs a network adapter to configure Kubernetes Services IPs and
    uses the adapter for proxying connections to Service. Use following script
    to create the network adapter. The adapter will be deleted automatically by
    Windows after the Windows Node reboots.

    Starting from Kubernetes 1.26, the kube-proxy userspace mode is no longer
    supported. For clusters running a version higher than 1.26, you should skip
    the preparation of the kube-proxy network adapter by executing the command
    `.\Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1 -InstallKubeProxy $false`.

* Remove stale network resources created by antrea-agent.

    After the Windows Node reboots, there will be stale network resources which
    need to be cleaned before starting antrea-agent.

* Ensure OVS services are running.

    This script starts OVS services on the Node if they are not running. This step
    needs to be skipped in case of OVS containerization. Hence, you need to specify
    the parameter `RunOVSServices` as false.

    ```powershell
    & C:\k\antrea\Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1 -RunOVSServices $false
    ```

As you know from the task details from above, the script must be executed every
time you restart the Node to prepare the environment for antrea-agent.

You could make the script be executed automatically after Windows startup by
using different methods. Here're two examples for your reference:

* Example1: Update kubelet service.

Insert following line in kubelet service script `c:\k\StartKubelet.ps1` to invoke
`Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1` when starting kubelet service:

```powershell
& C:\k\antrea\Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1
```

* Example2: Create a ScheduledJob that runs at startup.

```powershell
$trigger = New-JobTrigger -AtStartup -RandomDelay 00:00:30 
$options = New-ScheduledJobOption -RunElevated
Register-ScheduledJob -Name PrepareAntreaAgent -Trigger $trigger  -ScriptBlock { Invoke-Expression C:\k\antrea\Prepare-AntreaAgent.ps1 } -ScheduledJobOption $options
```

##### 5. Run kubeadm to join the Node

On Windows Node, run the `kubeadm join` command to join the cluster. The token
is provided by the control-plane Node. If you forgot the token, or the token
has expired, you can run `kubeadm token create --print-join-command`
(on the control-plane Node) to generate a new token and join command. An example
`kubeadm join` command is like below:

```powershell
kubeadm join 192.168.101.5:6443 --token tdp0jt.rshv3uobkuoobb4v  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:84a163e57bf470f18565e44eaa2a657bed4da9748b441e9643ac856a274a30b9
```

Then, set the Node IP used by kubelet.
Open file `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env`:

```text
KUBELET_KUBEADM_ARGS="--network-plugin=cni --pod-infra-container-image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:1.3.0"
```

Append `--node-ip=$NODE_IP` at the end of params. Replace `$NODE_IP` with
the address for kubelet. It should look like:

```text
KUBELET_KUBEADM_ARGS="--network-plugin=cni --pod-infra-container-image=mcr.microsoft.com/oss/kubernetes/pause:1.3.0 --node-ip=$NODE_IP"
```

Restart kubelet service for changes to take effect.

```powershell
restart-service kubelet
```

##### Verify your installation

There will be temporary network interruption on Windows worker Node on the
first startup of antrea-agent. It's because antrea-agent will set the OVS to
take over the host network. After that you should be able to view the Windows
Nodes and Pods in your cluster by running:

```bash
# Show Nodes
kubectl get nodes -o wide -n kube-system
NAME                           STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                                  KERNEL-VERSION     CONTAINER-RUNTIME

```

### Add Windows kube-proxy DaemonSet (only for Kubernetes versions prior to 1.26)

Starting from Kubernetes 1.26, Antrea will no longer support Windows kube-proxy
because kube-proxy userspace mode is deprecated and kernelspace mode does not
work with Antrea. For a cluster with Kubernetes version 1.26 or later, please
refer to [Deploying Antrea on Windows Worker Node](#Deploying-Antrea-on-Windows-Worker-Node)

First, deploy a Windows-compatible version of kube-proxy. You can download `kube-proxy.yaml`
from the Kubernetes github repository to deploy kube-proxy. The kube-proxy version
in the YAML file must be set to a Windows compatible version. The following command
downloads and applies `kube-proxy.yml`:

```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/sig-windows-tools/releases/download/v0.1.5/kube-proxy.yml" | sed 's/VERSION-nanoserver/v1.20.0/g' > kube-proxy.yml
```

Replace the content of `run-script.ps1` in the `kube-proxy-windows` ConfigMap
with following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  run-script.ps1: |-
    $ErrorActionPreference = "Stop";
    mkdir -force /host/var/lib/kube-proxy/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
    mkdir -force /host/k/kube-proxy

    cp -force /k/kube-proxy/* /host/k/kube-proxy
    cp -force /var/lib/kube-proxy/* /host/var/lib/kube-proxy
    cp -force /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/* /host/var/lib/kube-proxy/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

    wins cli process run --path /k/kube-proxy/kube-proxy.exe --args "--v=3 --config=/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf --proxy-mode=userspace --hostname-override=$env:NODE_NAME"

kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: kube-proxy
  name: kube-proxy-windows
  namespace: kube-system
```

For containerd runtime, replace the content of `run-script.ps1` with following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  run-script.ps1: |-
    $mountPath = $env:CONTAINER_SANDBOX_MOUNT_POINT
    $mountPath =  ($mountPath.Replace('\', '/')).TrimEnd('/') 
    New-Item -Path "c:/var/lib" -Name "kube-proxy" -ItemType "directory" -Force
    ((Get-Content -path $mountPath/var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig.conf -Raw) -replace '/var',"$($mountPath)/var") | Set-Content -Path /var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig.conf
    ((Get-Content -path /var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig.conf -Raw) -replace '\/',"/") | Set-Content -Path /var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig.conf
    sed -i 's/mode: iptables/mode: \"\"/g' $mountPath/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf
    & "$mountPath/k/kube-proxy/kube-proxy.exe" --config=$mountPath/var/lib/kube-proxy/config.conf --v=10 --proxy-mode=userspace --hostname-override=$env:NODE_NAME
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  labels:
    app: kube-proxy
  name: kube-proxy-windows
  namespace: kube-system
```

Set the `hostNetwork` option to `true` in spec of kube-proxy-windows DaemonSet spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: kube-proxy
  name: kube-proxy-windows
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: kube-proxy-windows
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: kube-proxy-windows
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
```

For containerd runtime, also add the following to the kube-proxy-windows DaemonSet spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  labels:
    k8s-app: kube-proxy
  name: kube-proxy-windows
  namespace: kube-system
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      k8s-app: kube-proxy-windows
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        k8s-app: kube-proxy-windows
    spec:
      securityContext:
        windowsOptions:
          hostProcess: true
          runAsUserName: "NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"
      hostNetwork: true
      serviceAccountName: kube-proxy
      containers:
      - command:
        - pwsh
        args:
        - -file
        - $env:CONTAINER_SANDBOX_MOUNT_POINT/var/lib/kube-proxy-windows/run-script.ps1
```

Then apply the `kube-proxy.yml`.

```bash
kubectl apply -f kube-proxy.yml
```

### Manually run kube-proxy and antrea-agent on Windows worker Nodes

Aside from starting kube-proxy and antrea-agent from the management Pods, Antrea
also provides powershell scripts which help install and run these two components
directly without Pod. Please complete the steps in [Installation](#Installation)
section, skip [Add Windows kube-proxy DaemonSet](#Add-Windows-kube-proxy-DaemonSet)
and [Add Windows antrea-agent DaemonSet](#Add-Windows-antrea-agent-DaemonSet)
steps. And then run the following commands in powershell.

```powershell
mkdir c:\k\antrea
cd c:\k\antrea
curl.exe -LO https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases/download/<TAG>/Start-AntreaAgent.ps1
# Run antrea-agent without kube-proxy
# $KubeConfigPath is the path of kubeconfig file
./Start-AntreaAgent.ps1 -kubeconfig $KubeConfigPath -StartKubeProxy $false
# Run Antrea-Agent with kube-proxy (deprecated since Kubernetes 1.26)
# ./Start-AntreaAgent.ps1 -kubeconfig $KubeConfigPath -StartKubeProxy $true
```

> Note: Some features such as supportbundle collection are not supported in this
> way. It's recommended to start kube-proxy and antrea-agent through management
> Pods.

## Known issues

1. HNS Network is not persistent on Windows. So after the Windows Node reboots,
the HNS Network created by antrea-agent is removed, and the Open vSwitch
Extension is disabled by default. In this case, the stale OVS bridge and ports
should be removed. A help script [Clean-AntreaNetwork.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/hack/windows/Clean-AntreaNetwork.ps1)
can be used to clean the OVS bridge.

    ```powershell
    # If OVS userspace processes were running as a Service on Windows host
    ./Clean-AntreaNetwork.ps1 -OVSRunMode "service"
    # If OVS userspace processes were running inside container in antrea-agent Pod
    ./Clean-AntreaNetwork.ps1 -OVSRunMode "container"
    ```  

2. Hyper-V feature cannot be installed on Windows Node due to the processor not
having the required virtualization capabilities.

    If the processor of the Windows Node does not have the required
    virtualization capabilities. The installation of Hyper-V feature will fail
    with the following error:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\Users\Administrator> Install-WindowsFeature Hyper-V

    Success Restart Needed Exit Code      Feature Result
    ------- -------------- ---------      --------------
    False   Maybe          Failed         {}
    Install-WindowsFeature : A prerequisite check for the Hyper-V feature failed.
    1. Hyper-V cannot be installed: The processor does not have required virtualization capabilities.
    At line:1 char:1
    + Install-WindowsFeature hyper-v
    + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Hyper-V:ServerComponentWrapper) [Install-WindowsFeature], Exception
        + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Alteration_PrerequisiteCheck_Failed,Microsoft.Windows.ServerManager.Commands.AddWindowsF
       eatureCommand
    ```

    The capabilities are required by the Hyper-V `hypervisor` components to
    support [Hyper-V isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#hyper-v-isolation).
    If you only need [Process Isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/hyperv-container#process-isolation)
    on the Nodes. You could apply the following workaround to skip CPU check for
    Hyper-V feature installation.

    ```powershell
    # 1. Install containers feature
    Install-WindowsFeature containers

    # 2. Install Hyper-V management powershell module
    Install-WindowsFeature Hyper-V-Powershell

    # 3. Install Hyper-V feature without CPU check and disable the "hypervisor"
    dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V /all /NoRestart
    dism /online /disable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V-Online /NoRestart

    # 4. Restart-Computer to take effect
    Restart-Computer
    ```
