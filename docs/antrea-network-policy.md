## Summary

Antrea supports standard K8s NetworkPolicies to secure traffic between Pods.
These NetworkPolicies are written from an application developer's perspective,
hence they lack the ability to gain a finer-grained control over the security
policies that a cluster administrator would require. This document describes a
few new CRDs supported by Antrea to provide the administrator with more control
over security within the cluster, and which are meant to co-exist with and
complement the K8s NetworkPolicy.

## Tier

Antrea supports grouping Antrea Policy CRDs together in a tiered fashion
to provide a hierarchy of security policies. This is achieved by setting the
`tier` field when defining an Antrea Policy CRD (e.g. a ClusterNetworkPolicy
object) to the appropriate tier name. Each tier has a priority associated with
it, which determines its relative order among all tiers.

**Note**: K8s NetworkPolicies will be enforced once all tiers have been
enforced.

### Tier CRDs

Creating Tiers as CRDs allows users the flexibility to create and delete
Tiers as per their preference i.e. not be bound to 5 static tiering options
as was the case initially.

An example Tier might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: Tier
metadata:
  name: mytier
spec:
  priority: 10
  description: "my custom tier"
```

Tiers have the following characteristics:

- Policies can associate themselves with an existing Tier by setting the `tier`
  field in a Antrea NetworkPolicy CRD spec to the Tier's name.
- A Tier must exist before an Antrea policy can reference it.
- Policies associated with higher ordered (low `priority` value) Tiers are
  enforced first.
- No two Tiers can be created with the same priority.
- Updating the Tier's `priority` field is unsupported.
- Deleting Tier with existing references from policies is not allowed.

### Static tiers

Antrea release 0.9.x introduced support for 5 static tiers. These static tiers
have been removed in favor of Tier CRDs as mentioned in the previous section.
On startup, antrea-controller will create 5 Read-Only Tier resources
corresponding to the static tiers for default consumption as shown below.

```
    Emergency -> Tier name "emergency" with priority "5"
    SecurityOps -> Tier name "securityops" with priority "50"
    NetworkOps -> Tier name "networkops" with priority "100"
    Platform -> Tier name "platform" with priority "150"
    Application -> Tier name "application" with priority "250"
```

Any Antrea policy CRD referencing a static tier in its spec will now internally
reference the corresponding Tier resource, thus maintaining the order of
enforcement.

Previously, the static tiers created were as follows in the relative order of
precedence:

```
    Emergency > SecurityOps > NetworkOps > Platform > Application  
```

Thus, all Antrea Policy resources associated with "Emergency" tier will be
enforced before any other Antrea Policy resource associated with any other
tier, until a match occurs, in which case the policy rule's `action` will be
applied. The "Application" tier carries the lowest precedence, and any Antrea
Policy resource without a `tier` name set in its spec will be associated with
the "Application" tier. Even though the policies associated with the
"Application" tier carry the lowest precedence amongst all the tiers, they are
still enforced before K8s NetworkPolicies. Thus, admin-created tiered Antrea
Policy CRDs have a higher precedence than developer-created K8s
NetworkPolicies.

### kubectl commands for Tier

The following kubectl commands can be used to retrieve Tier resources:

```
    # Use long name
    kubectl get tiers

    # Use long name with API Group
    kubectl get tiers.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com

    # Use short name
    kubectl get tr

    # Use short name with API Group
    kubectl get tr.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com

    # Sort output by Tier priority
    kubectl get tiers --sort-by=.spec.priority
```

All of the above commands produce output similar to what is shown below:

```
    NAME          PRIORITY   AGE
    emergency     5          27h
    securityops   50         27h
    networkops    100        27h
    platform      150        27h
    application   250        27h
```

## Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy

Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy (ACNP), one of the two Antrea Policy CRDs
introduced, is a specification of how workloads within a cluster communicate
with each other and other external endpoints. The ClusterNetworkPolicy is
supposed to aid cluster admins to configure the security policy for the
cluster, unlike K8s NetworkPolicy, which is aimed towards developers to secure
their apps and affects Pods within the Namespace in which the K8s NetworkPolicy
is created. Rules belonging to ClusterNetworkPolicies are enforced before any
rule belonging to a K8s NetworkPolicy.

**Note**: ClusterNetworkPolicy is currently in "Alpha" stage. In order to
enable them, edit the Controller and Agent configuration in the `antrea`
ConfigMap as follows:

```yaml
   antrea-controller.conf: |
     featureGates:
       # Enable AntreaPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy
       # for cluster admins to define security policies which apply to the
       # entire cluster.
       AntreaPolicy: true
```
```yaml
   antrea-agent.conf: |
     featureGates:
       # Enable AntreaPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy
       # for cluster admins to define security policies which apply to the
       # entire cluster.
       AntreaPolicy: true
```

### The Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy resource

An example ClusterNetworkPolicy might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-cnp
spec:
    priority: 5
    tier: securityops
    appliedTo:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            role: db
      - namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            env: prod
    ingress:
      - action: Allow
        from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: frontend
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: nondb
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: db
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 8080
        name: AllowFromFrontend
    egress:
      - action: Drop
        to:
          - ipBlock:
              cidr: 10.0.10.0/24
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 5978
        name: DropToThirdParty
```

**spec**: The ClusterNetworkPolicy `spec` has all the information needed to
define a cluster-wide security policy.

**appliedTo**: The `appliedTo` field specifies the grouping criteria of Pods to
which the policy applies to. Pods can be selected cluster-wide using
`podSelector`. If set with a `namespaceSelector`, all Pods from Namespaces
selected by the namespaceSelector will be selected. Specific Pods from
specific Namespaces can be selected by providing both a `podSelector` and a
`namespaceSelector` in the same `appliedTo` entry.
IPBlock cannot be set in the `appliedTo` field.
In the example, the policy applies to Pods, which either match the labels
"role=db" in all the Namespaces, or are from Namespaces which match the
labels "env=prod".

**priority**: The `priority` field determines the relative priority of the
policy among all ClusterNetworkPolicies in the given cluster. This field is
mandatory. A lower priority value indicates higher precedence. Priority values
can range from 1.0 to 10000.0.
**Note**: Policies with the same priorities will be enforced
indeterministically. Users should therefore take care to use priorities to
ensure the behavior they expect.

**tier**: The `tier` field associates an ACNP to an existing Tier. The `tier`
field can be set with the name of the Tier CRD to which this policy must be
associated with. If not set, the ACNP is associated with the lowest priority
default tier i.e. the "application" Tier.

**ingress**: Each ClusterNetworkPolicy may consist of zero or more ordered
set of ingress rules. Each rule, depending on the `action` field of the rule,
allows or drops traffic which matches both the `from` and `ports` sections.
Also, each rule has an optional `name` field, which is unique within the policy 
describing the intention of this rule.
The example policy contains a single rule, which allows matched traffic on a
single port, from one of two sources: the first specified by a `podSelector`
and the second specified by a combination of a `podSelector` and a
`namespaceSelector`.
**Note**: The order in which the ingress rules are set matter, i.e. rules will
be enforced in the order in which they are written.

**egress**: Each ClusterNetworkPolicy may consist of zero or more ordered set
of egress rules. Each rule, depending on the `action` field of the rule, allows
or drops traffic which matches both the `to` and `ports` sections. 
Also, each rule has an optional `name` field, which is unique within the policy 
describing the intention of this rule.
The example policy contains a single rule, which drops matched traffic on a 
single port, to the 10.0.10.0/24 subnet specified by the `ipBlock` field. 
**Note**: The order in which the egress rules are set matter, i.e. rules will
be enforced in the order in which they are written.

### Behavior of *to* and *from* selectors

There are four kinds of selectors that can be specified in an ingress `from`
section or egress `to` section:

**podSelector**: This selects particular Pods from all Namespaces as "sources",
if set in `ingress` section, or as "destinations", if set in `egress` section.

**namespaceSelector**: This selects particular Namespaces for which all Pods
are grouped as `ingress` "sources" or `egress` "destinations".

**podSelector** and **namespaceSelector**:  A single to/from entry that
specifies both namespaceSelector and podSelector selects particular Pods within
particular Namespaces. 

**ipBlock**: This selects particular IP CIDR ranges to allow as `ingress`
"sources" or `egress` "destinations". These should be cluster-external IPs,
since Pod IPs are ephemeral and unpredictable.

### Key differences from K8s NetworkPolicy

- ClusterNetworkPolicy is at the cluster scope, hence a `podSelector` without
  any `namespaceSelector` selects Pods from all Namespaces.
- There is no automatic isolation of Pods on being selected in appliedTo.
- Ingress/Egress rules in ClusterNetworkPolicy has an `action` field which
  specifies whether the matched rule allows or drops the traffic.
- IPBlock field in the ClusterNetworkPolicy rules do not have the `except`
  field. A higher priority rule can be written to deny the specific CIDR range
  to simulate the behavior of IPBlock field with `cidr` and `except` set.
- Rules assume the priority in which they are written. i.e. rule set at top
  takes precedence over a rule set below it.

### kubectl commands for Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy

The following kubectl commands can be used to retrieve ACNP resources:

```
    # Use long name
    kubectl get clusternetworkpolicies

    # Use long name with API Group
    kubectl get clusternetworkpolicies.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com

    # Use short name
    kubectl get acnp

    # Use short name with API Group
    kubectl get acnp.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com
```

All of the above commands produce output similar to what is shown below:

```
    NAME       TIER        PRIORITY   AGE
    test-cnp   emergency   5          54s
```

## Antrea NetworkPolicy

Antrea NetworkPolicy (ANP) is another Policy CRD, which is similar to the
ClusterNetworkPolicy CRD, however its scope is limited to a Namespace.
The purpose of introducing this CRD is to allow admins to take advantage of
advanced NetworkPolicy features and apply them within a Namespace to
complement the K8s NetworkPolicies. Similar to the ClusterNetworkPolicy
resource, Antrea NetworkPolicy can also be associated with Tiers.

**Note**: Antrea NetworkPolicy is currently in "Alpha" stage and is enabled
along with Tiers and ClusterNetworkPolicy as part of the `AntreaPolicy`
feature gate.

### The Antrea NetworkPolicy resource

An example Antrea NetworkPolicy might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-anp
  namespace: default
spec:
    priority: 5
    tier: securityops
    appliedTo:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            role: db
    ingress:
      - action: Allow
        from:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: frontend
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: nondb
            namespaceSelector:
              matchLabels:
                role: db
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 8080
        name: AllowFromFrontend
    egress:
      - action: Drop
        to:
          - ipBlock:
              cidr: 10.0.10.0/24
        ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 5978
        name: DropToThirdParty
```

### Key differences from Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy

Antrea NetworkPolicy shares it's spec with ClusterNetworkPolicy. However,
the following documents some of the key differences between the two Antrea
Policy CRDs.

- Antrea NetworkPolicy is Namespaced while ClusterNetworkPolicy operates at
  cluster scope.
- Unlike the `appliedTo` in a ClusterNetworkPolicy, setting a
  `namespaceSelector` in the `appliedTo` field is forbidden.
- `podSelector` without a `namespaceSelector`, set within a NetworkPolicy Peer
  of any rule, selects Pods from the Namespace in which the Antrea
  NetworkPolicy is created. This behavior is similar to the K8s NetworkPolicy.

### kubectl commands for Antrea NetworkPolicy

The following kubectl commands can be used to retrieve ANP resources:

```
    # Use long name with API Group
    kubectl get networkpolicies.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com

    # Use short name
    kubectl get anp

    # Use short name with API Group
    kubectl get anp.security.antrea.tanzu.vmware.com
```

All of the above commands produce output similar to what is shown below:

```
    NAME       TIER          PRIORITY   AGE
    test-anp   securityops   5          5s
```

## Antrea Policy ordering based on priorities

Antrea Policy CRDs are ordered based on priorities set at various levels.

### Ordering based on Tier priority

With the introduction of tiers, Antrea Policies, like ClusterNetworkPolicies,
are first enforced based on the Tier to which they are associated. i.e. all
policies belonging to a high Tier are enforced first, followed by policies
belonging to the next Tier and so on, until the "application" Tier policies
are enforced.

### Ordering based on policy priority

Within a tier, Antrea Policy CRDs are ordered by the `priority` at the policy
level. Thus, the policy with the highest precedence (lowest priority number
value) is enforced first. This ordering is performed solely based on the
`priority` assigned as opposed to the "Kind" of the resource, i.e. the relative
ordering between a [ClusterNetworkPolicy resource](#antrea-clusternetworkpolicy) and an [Antrea NetworkPolicy
resource](#antrea-networkpolicy) within a Tier depends only on the `priority`
set in each of the two resources.

### Rule enforcement based on priorities

Within a policy, rules are enforced in the order in which they are set. For example,
consider the following:

- ACNP1{tier: application, priority: 10, ingressRules: [ir1.1, ir1.2], egressRules: [er1.1, er1.2]}
- ANP1{tier: application, priority: 15, ingressRules: [ir2.1, ir2.2], egressRules: [er2.1, er2.2]}
- ACNP3{tier: emergency, priority: 20, ingressRules: [ir3.1, ir3.2], egressRules: [er3.1, er3.2]}

This translates to the following order:
- Ingress rules: ir3.1 > ir3.2 > ir1.1 -> ir1.2 -> ir2.1 -> ir2.2
- Egress rules: er3.1 > er3.2 > er1.1 -> er1.2 -> er2.1 -> er2.2

Once a rule is matched, it is executed based on the action set. If none of the
policy rules match, the packet is then enforced for rules created for K8s NP.
Hence, Antrea Policy CRDs take precedence over K8s NP.

## RBAC

Antrea Policy CRDs are meant for admins to manage the security of their
cluster. Thus, access to manage these CRDs must be granted to subjects which
have the authority to outline the security policies for the cluster and/or
Namespaces. On cluster initialization, Antrea grants the permissions to edit
these CRDs with `admin` and the `edit` ClusterRole. In addition to this, Antrea
also grants the permission to view these CRDs with the `view` ClusterRole.
Cluster admins can therefore grant these ClusterRoles to any subject who may
be responsible to manage the Antrea Policy CRDs. The admins may also decide to
share the `view` ClusterRole to a wider range of subjects to allow them to read
the policies that may affect their workloads.

## Notes

- There is a soft limit of 20 on the maximum number of Tier resources that are
  supported. But for optimal performance, it is recommended that the number of
  Tiers in a cluster be less than or equal to 10.
- The v1alpha1 Policy CRDs support up to 10000 unique priority at policy level.
  In order to reduce the churn in the agent, it is recommended to set the
  priority within the range 1.0 to 100.0.

## Known Issues

- Creating an Antrea NetworkPolicy with the same name as a K8s NetworkPolicy
  under the same Namespace creates a collision and causes unexpected behavior.
  See issue [1173](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/issues/1173) for more details.
