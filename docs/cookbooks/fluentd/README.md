# Using Antrea with Fluentd

This guide will describe how to use Project Antrea with
[Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset),
in order for efficient audit logging.
In this scenario, Antrea is used for the default network,
[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is used for the default storage,
and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/) dashboard is used for visualization.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisites are:

* a K8s cluster (Linux Nodes) running a K8s version supported by Antrea.
* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

All the required software will be deployed using YAML manifests, and the
corresponding container images will be downloaded from public registries.

## Practical steps

### Step 1: Deploying Antrea

For detailed information on the Antrea requirements and instructions on how to
deploy Antrea, please refer to
[getting-started.md](../../getting-started.md). To deploy the latest version of
Antrea, use:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antrea-io/antrea/main/build/yamls/antrea.yml
```

You may also choose a [released Antrea
version](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/releases).

### Step 2: Deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana Dashboard

Fluentd supports multiple [output plugins](https://www.fluentd.org/plugins).
Details will be discussed in [Step 4](#step-4-deploy-fluentd-daemonset), but
by default, log records are collected by Fluentd DaemonSet and sent to Elasticsearch.
A Kibana Dashboard can then be used to visualize the data. The YAML file for
deployment is included in the `resources` directory. To deploy Elasticsearch
and Kibana, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f docs/cookbooks/fluentd/resources/kibana-elasticsearch.yml
```

### Step 3: Configure Custom Fluentd Plugins

The architecture of Fluentd is a pipeline from input-> parser-> buffer->
output-> formatter, many of these are plugins that could be configured to
fit usersâ€™ different use cases.

To specify custom input plugins and parsers, modify `./resources/kubernetes.conf`
and create a ConfigMap with the following command. Later, direct Fluentd
DaemonSet to refer to that ConfigMap. To see more variations of custom
configuration, refer to [Fluentd inputs](https://docs.fluentd.org/input).
This cookbook uses the [tail](https://docs.fluentd.org/input/tail)
input plugin to monitor the audit logging files for Antrea-native policies
on every K8s Node.

```bash
kubectl create configmap fluentd-conf --from-file=docs/cookbooks/fluentd/resources/kubernetes.conf --namespace=kube-logging
```

### Step 4: Deploy Fluentd DaemonSet

Fluentd deployment includes RBAC and DaemonSet. Fluentd will collect logs
from cluster components, so permissions need to be granted first through
RBAC. In `fluentd.yml`, we create a ServiceAccount, and use a ClusterRole
and a ClusterRoleBinding to grant it permissions to read, list and watch
Pods in cluster scope.

In the DaemonSet configuration, specify Elasticsearch host, port and scheme,
as they are required by the Elasticsearch output plugin.
In [Fluentd official documentation](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-kubernetes-daemonset),
output plugins are specified in `fluent.conf` depending on the chosen image.
To change output plugins, choose a different image and specify it in `./resources/fluentd.yml`.
When choosing image version, note that the current Elasticsearch version
specified in `resources/kibana-elasticsearch.yml` is 7.8.0 and that the major
Elasticsearch version must match between the 2 files.

```bash
kubectl apply -f docs/cookbooks/fluentd/resources/fluentd.yml
```

### Step 5: Visualize with Kibana Dashboard

Navigate to `http://[NodeIP]: 30007` and create an index pattern with "fluentd-*".
Go to `http://[NodeIP]: 30007/app/kibana#/discover` to see the results as below.

## Email Alerting

Kibana dashboard supports creating alerts with the logs in this
[guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/alerting-getting-started.html).
This [documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/how-to-guides/splunk-like-grep-and-alert-email)
also provides a detailed guide for email alerting when using td-agent
(the stable version of Fluentd and preconfigured).

For this cookbook with custom Fluentd configuration, modify and add the following
code to `./resources/kubernetes.conf`, then update ConfigMap in
[Step 3: Configure Custom Fluentd Plugins](#step-3-configure-custom-fluentd-plugins).

```editorconfig
<match antrea-networkpolicy>
  @type grepcounter
  count_interval 3  # The time window for counting errors (in secs)
  input_key code    # The field to apply the regular expression
  regexp ^5\d\d$    # The regular expression to be applied
  threshold 1       # The minimum number of erros to trigger an alert
  add_tag_prefix error_ANPxx  # Generate tags like "error_ANPxx.antrea-networkpolicy"
</match>

<match error_5xx.antrea-networkpolicy>
  @type copy  
  <store>
    @type stdout  # Print to stdout for debugging
  </store>
  <store>
    @type mail
    host smtp.gmail.com        # Change this to your SMTP server host
    port 587                   # Normally 25/587/465 are used for submission
    user USERNAME              # Use your username to log in
    password PASSWORD          # Use your login password
    enable_starttls_auto true  # Use this option to enable STARTTLS
    from example@antrea.com    # Set the sender address
    to alert@example.com       # Set the recipient address
    subject 'Antrea Native Policy Error'
    message Total ANPxx error count: %s\n\nPlease check Antrea Native Policy feature ASAP
    message_out_keys count     # Use the "count" field to replace "%s" above
  </store>
</match>
```
