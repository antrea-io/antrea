# Antrea Feature Gates

This page contains an overview of the various features an administrator can turn
on or off for Antrea components. We follow the same convention as the
[Kubernetes feature
gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/).

In particular:

* a feature in the Alpha stage will be disabled by default but can be enabled by
  editing the appropriate `.conf` entry in the Antrea manifest.
* a feature in the Beta stage will be enabled by default but can be disabled by
  editing the appropriate `.conf` entry in the Antrea manifest.
* a feature in the GA stage will be enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

Some features are specific to the Agent, others are specific to the Controller,
and some apply to both and should be enabled / disabled consistently in both
`.conf` entries.

To enable / disable a feature, edit the Antrea manifest appropriately. For
example, to enable `AntreaProxy` on Linux, edit the Agent configuration in the
`antrea` ConfigMap as follows:

```yaml
  antrea-agent.conf: |
    # FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
    featureGates:
    # Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster Services in antrea agent.
    # It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
    # Service traffic.
      AntreaProxy: true
```

## Description and Requirements of Features

### AntreaProxy

`AntreaProxy` implements Service load-balancing for ClusterIP Services as part
of the OVS pipeline, as opposed to relying on kube-proxy. This only applies to
traffic originating from Pods, and destined to ClusterIP Services. In
particular, it does not apply to NodePort Services.

Note that this feature must be enabled for Windows. The Antrea Windows YAML
manifest provided as part of releases enables this feature by default. If you
edit the manifest, make sure you do not disable it, as it is needed for correct
NetworkPolicy implementation for Pod-to-Service traffic.

#### Requirements for this Feature

When using the OVS built-in kernel module (which is the most common case), your
kernel version must be >= 4.6 (as opposed to >= 4.4 without this feature).

### AntreaPolicy

`AntreaPolicy` enables Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy and Antrea NetworkPolicy CRDs to be
handled by Antrea controller. `ClusterNetworkPolicy` is an Antrea-specific extension to K8s
NetworkPolicies, which enables cluster admins to define security policies which
apply to the entire cluster. `Antrea NetworkPolicy` also complements K8s NetworkPolicies
by supporting policy priorities and rule actions.
Refer to this [document](antrea-network-policy.md) for more information.

#### Requirements for this Feature

None

### Traceflow

`Traceflow` enables a CRD API for Antrea that supports generating tracing
requests for traffic going through the Antrea-managed Pod network. This is
useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues, e.g. determining if a
NetworkPolicy is responsible for traffic drops between two Pods. Refer to
this [document](traceflow-guide.md) for more information.

#### Requirements for this Feature

Until Antrea v0.11, this feature could only be used in "encap" mode, with the
Geneve tunnel type (default configuration for both Linux and Windows). In v0.11,
this feature was graduated to Beta (enabled by default) and this requirement was
lifted.

In order to support cluster Services as the destination for tracing requests,
`AntreaProxy` should be enabled, which is the default starting with Antrea
v0.11.

### Flow Exporter

`Flow Exporter` is a feature that runs as part of the Antrea Agent, and enables
network flow visibility into a Kubernetes cluster. Flow exporter sends
IPFIX flow records that are built from observed connections in Conntrack module
to a flow collector. Refer to this [document](network-flow-visibility.md) for more information.

#### Requirements for this Feature

This feature is currently only supported for Nodes running Linux.
Windows support will be added in the future.

### NetworkPolicyStats

`NetworkPolicyStats` enables collecting NetworkPolicy statistics from
antrea-agents and exposing them through Antrea Stats API, which can be accessed
by kubectl get commands, e.g. `kubectl get networkpolicystats`. The statistical
data includes total number of sessions, packets, and bytes allowed or denied by
a NetworkPolicy. It is collected asynchronously so there may be a delay of up to
1 minute for changes to be reflected in API responses. The feature supports K8s
NetworkPolicies and Antrea native policies, the latter of which requires
`AntreaPolicy` to be enabled. Usage examples:

```bash
# List stats of all K8s NetworkPolicies.
> kubectl get networkpolicystats -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                  SESSIONS   PACKETS   BYTES   CREATED AT
default       access-nginx          3          36        5199    2020-09-07T13:19:38Z
kube-system   access-dns            1          12        1221    2020-09-07T13:22:42Z

# List stats of all Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicies.
> kubectl get antreaclusternetworkpolicystats

# List stats of all Antrea NetworkPolicies.
> kubectl get antreanetworkpolicystats -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                  SESSIONS   PACKETS   BYTES   CREATED AT

```
