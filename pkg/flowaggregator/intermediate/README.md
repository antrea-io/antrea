# IPFIX Aggregation

This code was originally contributed to the [vmware/go-ipfix](https://github.com/vmware/go-ipfix)
library, under Apache 2.0 license, as the `github.com/vmware/go-ipfix/intermediate`
package. However, because the code ended up being Antrea-specific, it eventually made more sense to
migrate it to this repository.
