# This script is required for Antrea to work properly in a Kind cluster on Linux. It takes care of
# disabling TX hardware checksum offload for the veth interface (in the host's network namespace) of
# each Kind Node. This is required when using OVS in userspace mode. Refer to
# https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/issues/14 for more information.

# The script uses the antrea/ethtool Docker image (so that ethtool does not need to be installed on
# the Linux host).
