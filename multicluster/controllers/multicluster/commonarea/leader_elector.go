/**
 * Lets consider a ClusterSet with 2 leader clusters and 1 member cluster.
 *  Leader1        Leader2
 *       \         /
 *        \       /
 *         -------
 *            ^
 *            |
 *         Member1
 * The member cluster connects to both leaders. It writes MemberClusterAnnounce
 * and other resources into CommonArea of both leaders. However, resources
 * are imported only from an elected-leader cluster.
 *
 * This interface performs the election to pick an elected-leader
 * from the list of leader clusters in the ClusterSet spec.
 *
 * Leader election picks an elected-leader among "connected" leaders
 * by choosing one randomly.
 * The member cluster periodically writes MemberClusterAnnounce into every leader
 * cluster and is considered "connected" if it can successfully write so.
 * After leader election is done, the result is also used to update the
 * spec of MemberClusterAnnounce during the next periodic write into the
 * leader's CommonArea, so the leader knows it is the elected-leader of this
 * member (mainly for visibility and reporting).
