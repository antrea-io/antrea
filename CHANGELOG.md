# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.  The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Features in Alpha or Beta stage are tagged as such. We try to follow the same conventions as
Kubernetes for [feature development
stages](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions).

## Unreleased

## 0.2.0 - 2019-12-19

The Monitoring [CRDs] feature is graduated from Alpha to Beta.

### Added

- Add "Last Hearbeat Time" to [Octant] plugin to visualize the last time the Agent / Controller reported its status.
- Add OVS version to Agent's monitoring CRD.
- Add instructions to run [Octant] and the Antrea plugin either in a Pod or as a process. A Dockerfile and YAML manifest are included for deploying [Octant] as a Pod.
- Support for GRE and STT tunnels for the Pod overlay network.

### Changed

- Use [libOpenflow] Go library to manage OVS flows instead of ovs-ofctl binary.
- Minor changes to the OVS pipeline, in particular to fix issues when using the netdev OVS datapath type.
- Officially-supported Go version is no longer 1.12 but 1.13.

### Fixed

- Allow the Node to reach all local Pods to support liveness probes even in the presence of Network Policies.
- Network Policy fixes:
   * fix implementation of Network Policies with multiple ingress / egress rules
   * support "except" field for "ipBlock" selectors
   * fix support for [default policies]
   * faster Network Policy enforcement by letting the CNI server notify the Agent's Network Policy controller when Pods are created
   * fix race condition that sometimes caused Network Policy span not to be updated properly and the Network Policy not to be disseminated to Nodes properly
   * ignore policy rules using named ports instead of allowing all traffic
- Remove stale Agent [CRDs] from the Controller: the Controller watches the Node list and removes the appropriate Agent CRD when a Node is deleted from the cluster.

## 0.1.1 - 2019-11-27

### Fixed

- Find host-local IPAM plugin even when kubelet is started with custom cni-bin-dir.
- Ensure that the Gratuitous ARP sent after adding container interface is not dropped. This ensures we can pass Kubernetes conformance tests reliably.
- Fix Kind support on Linux hosts.

## 0.1.0 - 2019-11-18

### Added

- Support for configuring and cleaning-up Pod networking as per the [CNI spec]. VXLAN or GENEVE tunnels are used for Pod connectivity across Nodes. [Beta]
- Support for [Kubernetes Network Policies]. [Alpha]
- Monitoring [CRDs] published by both the Antrea Agent and Controller to expose monitoring information. [Alpha]
- [Octant] plugin for visualizing the monitoring CRDs published by the Antrea Agent and Controller. [Alpha]
