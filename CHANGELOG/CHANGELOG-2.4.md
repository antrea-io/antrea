### Fixed

- Enhance OVS commands for Antrea Windows to accelerate container recovery and improve robustness. ([#7228](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7228), [@XinShuYang])
- Configure routes via `ip route add` to avoid incorrect replacement of routes when the interface is managed by a network daemon. ([#7134](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7134), [@luolanzone])
- Restore secondary VLAN interface information and reconcile OVS ports after Agent restarts. ([#6853](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/6853), [@KMAnju-2021])
- Persist container netns with OVS port external IDs. ([#7199](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7199), [@[@jianjuns])
- Restore the existing SR-IOV secondary interface information when Agent restarts, using the information stored in the Pod NetworkStatus annotation, which ensures correct IP release and VF device name restoration after Pod deletion. ([#7240](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7240), [@luolanzone])
- Fix invalid template ID in FlowAggregator for IPFIX exporter. ([#7208](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7208), [@antoninbas])
- Fix race condition when getting metrics via `antctl` for FlowAggregator. ([#7230](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7230), [@antoninbas])
- Fix invalid IPFIX UDP traffic fragmentation in the Flow Aggregator. ([#7080](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7080), [@antoninbas])
- Fix invalid Antrea IE registry ID in docs. ([#7087](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7087), [@ColonelBundy])
- Remove stale local members in the group cache for Multicast, which resolves an issue that the same receiver may fail to receive multicast packets after it rejoins the group. ([#7154](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7154), [@wenyingd])
- Fix Agent crash when deleting the Secret storing BGP passwords. ([#7042](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7042), [@hongliangl])
- Fix rollback when `configureContainerLinkVeth` fails, to ensure subsequent retries can succeed. ([#7210](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7210) [#7213](https://github.com/antrea-io/antrea/pull/7213), [@tnqn])
