name: Dependabot Workflow

# This workflow commits to Dependabot branches to ensure that the corresponding
# PRs can satisfy all status checks.

# WARNING: Combining pull_request_target workflow trigger with an explicit
# checkout of an untrusted PR is a dangerous practice that may lead to
# repository compromise.
# See https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
# To prevent repository compromise, the workflow jobs must only execute on PRs
# opened by Dependabot and which are labelled correctly (note that these two
# checks are somewhat redundant since labelling PRs require write access to the
# repository).
# An alternative is to use the "two-workflow method" (see
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/automating-dependabot-with-github-actions#handling-push-events),
# but that is more tedious to configure and should not be required here.
