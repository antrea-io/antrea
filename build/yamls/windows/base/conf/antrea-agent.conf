# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster services in antrea agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic.
#  AntreaProxy: true

# Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
#  FlowExporter: false

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: antrea-gw0

# Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - stt
#tunnelType: geneve

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
# If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
# also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead.
#defaultMTU: 1450

# ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
# set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
# AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
#apiPort: 10350

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.
#enablePrometheusMetrics: true

# Provide the IPFIX collector address as a string with format <HOST>:[<PORT>][:<PROTO>].
# HOST can only be IP right now because there is a DNS resolution issue in current Windows support.
# IP can be either IPv4 or IPv6. However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
# If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.
# If no PROTO is given, we consider "tls" as default. We support "tls", "tcp" and
# "udp" protocols. "tls" is used for securing communication between flow exporter and
# flow aggregator.
#flowCollectorAddr: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc:4739:tls"

# Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the
# flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module. Flow poll interval
# should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#flowPollInterval: "5s"

# Provide the active flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
# record is sent to the collector for active flows. Thus, for flows with a continuous
# stream of packets, a flow record will be exported to the collector once the elapsed
# time since the last export event is equal to the value of this timeout.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#activeFlowExportTimeout: "30s"

# Provide the idle flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
# record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no
# packet matching this flow has been observed since the last export event.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#idleFlowExportTimeout: "15s"

# Enable TLS communication from flow exporter to flow aggregator.
#enableTLSToFlowAggregator: true

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options:
# encap(default):    Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to external network
#                    traffic is SNAT'd.
# noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
#                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
#                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
# hybrid:            noEncap if source and destination Nodes are on the same subnet, otherwise encap.
#
#trafficEncapMode: encap
