# Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster services in antrea agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.

# Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - stt

# omitted, antrea-agent will default this value to 1450 to accommodate for tunnel encapsulate
# overhead.
