# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster services in antrea agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic.
#  AntreaProxy: true

# Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
#  FlowExporter: false

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: antrea-gw0

# Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - stt
#tunnelType: geneve

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
# If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
# also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead.
#defaultMTU: 1450

# ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
# set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
# AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
#apiPort: 10350

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.
#enablePrometheusMetrics: true

# Provide flow collector address as string with format <IP>:<port>[:<proto>], where proto is tcp or udp.
# IP can be either IPv4 or IPv6. However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
# This also enables the flow exporter that sends IPFIX flow records of conntrack flows on OVS bridge.
# If no L4 transport proto is given, we consider tcp as default.
#flowCollectorAddr: ""

# Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module.
# Flow poll interval should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#flowPollInterval: "5s"

# Provide flow export frequency, which is the number of poll cycles elapsed before flow exporter exports flow records to
# the flow collector.
# Flow export frequency should be greater than or equal to 1.
#flowExportFrequency: 12
