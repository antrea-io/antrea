# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable running agent on an unmanaged VM/BM.
  ExternalNode: true

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.
  AntreaPolicy: true

# Enable collecting and exposing NetworkPolicy statistics.
  NetworkPolicyStats: true

# Enable collecting support bundle files with SupportBundleCollection CRD.
  SupportBundleCollection: true

# Log rotation configuration for audit logs.
auditLogging:
  # MaxSize is the maximum size in MB of a log file before it gets rotated.
  maxSize: 500
  # MaxBackups is the maximum number of old log files to retain. If set to 0,
  # all log files will be retained (unless MaxAge causes them to be deleted).
  maxBackups: 3
  # MaxAge is the maximum number of days to retain old log files based on the
  # timestamp encoded in their filename. If set to 0, old log files are not
  # removed based on age.
  maxAge: 28
  # Compress enables gzip compression on rotated files.
  compress: true
# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode (not fully supported yet). Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to
# be available.
#ovsDatapathType: system

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-agent` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10350

# NodeType is type of the Node where Antrea Agent is running.
# Defaults to "k8sNode". Valid values include "k8sNode", and "externalNode".
nodeType: externalNode

externalNode:
  # The expected Namespace in which the ExternalNode is created.
  # Defaults to "default".
  #externalNodeNamespace: default

  # The policyBypassRules describes the traffic that is expected to bypass NetworkPolicy rules.
  # Each rule contains the following four attributes:
  # direction (ingress|egress), protocol(tcp/udp/icmp/ip), remote CIDR, dst port (ICMP doesn't require).
  # Here is an example:
  #  - direction: ingress
  #    protocol: tcp
  #    cidr: 1.1.1.1/32
  #    port: 22
  # It is used only when NodeType is externalNode.
  #policyBypassRules: []

# The path to access the kubeconfig file used in the connection to K8s APIServer. The file contains the K8s
# APIServer endpoint and the token of ServiceAccount required in the connection.

# The path to access the kubeconfig file used in the connection to Antrea Controller. The file contains the
# antrea-controller APIServer endpoint and the token of ServiceAccount required in the connection.
