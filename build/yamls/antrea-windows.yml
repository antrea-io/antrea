    # FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
    featureGates:
    # Enable antrea proxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster services in antrea agent.
    # It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
    # Service traffic. Note that this feature gate is deprecated since this feature was
    # promoted to GA in v1.14.
    #  AntreaProxy: true

    # Enable NodePortLocal feature to make the Pods reachable externally through NodePort
    #  NodePortLocal: true

    # Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
    #  FlowExporter: false

    # Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
    #ovsBridge: br-int

    # Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
    #hostGateway: antrea-gw0

    # Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
    # - geneve (default)
    # - vxlan
    # - stt
    #tunnelType: geneve

    # TunnelPort is the destination port for UDP and TCP based tunnel protocols
    # (Geneve, VXLAN, and STT). If zero, it will use the assigned IANA port for the
    # protocol, i.e. 6081 for Geneve, 4789 for VXLAN, and 7471 for STT.
    #tunnelPort: 0

    # Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
    # If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
    # also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead.
    #defaultMTU: 1450

    # ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
    # set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
    # AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
    #serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

    # Provide the IPFIX collector address as a string with format <HOST>:[<PORT>][:<PROTO>].
    # HOST can either be the DNS name, IP, or Service name of the Flow Collector. If
    # using an IP, it can be either IPv4 or IPv6. However, IPv6 address should be
    # wrapped with []. When the collector is running in-cluster as a Service, set
    # <HOST> to <Service namespace>/<Service name>. For example,
    # "flow-aggregator/flow-aggregator" can be provided to connect to the Antrea
    # Flow Aggregator Service.
    # If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.
    # If no PROTO is given, we consider "tls" as default. We support "tls", "tcp" and

    # flow aggregator.

    # Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the
    # flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module. Flow poll interval

    #flowPollInterval: "5s"

    # Provide the active flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
    # record is sent to the collector for active flows. Thus, for flows with a continuous
    # stream of packets, a flow record will be exported to the collector once the elapsed
    # time since the last export event is equal to the value of this timeout.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
    #activeFlowExportTimeout: "30s"

    # Provide the idle flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
    # record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no
    # packet matching this flow has been observed since the last export event.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

    # encap(default):    Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to external network
    #                    traffic is SNAT'd.
    # noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
    #                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
    #                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
    # hybrid:            noEncap if source and destination Nodes are on the same subnet, otherwise encap.

    # Provide the port range used by NodePortLocal. When the NodePortLocal feature is enabled, a port
    # from that range will be assigned whenever a Pod's container defines a specific port to be exposed
    # (each container can define a list of ports as pod.spec.containers[].ports), and all Node traffic
    # directed to that port will be forwarded to the Pod.
