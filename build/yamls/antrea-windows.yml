    # It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
    # Service traffic.
    #  AntreaProxy: true

    # Enable EndpointSlice support in AntreaProxy. Don't enable this feature unless that EndpointSlice
    # API version v1beta1 is supported and set as enabled in Kubernetes. If AntreaProxy is not enabled,
    # this flag will not take effect.
    #  EndpointSlice: false

    # Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
    #  FlowExporter: false

    # Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.

    # Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
    #hostGateway: antrea-gw0

    # Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
    # - geneve (default)
    # - vxlan
    # - stt
    #tunnelType: geneve

    # Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
    # If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
    # also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead.
    #defaultMTU: 1450

    # ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
    # set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
    # AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.

    # time since the last export event is equal to the value of this timeout.

    #activeFlowExportTimeout: "30s"

    # record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no

    # noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
    #                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
    #                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
