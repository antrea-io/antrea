    # It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
    # Service traffic.
    #  AntreaProxy: true

    # Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.

    # Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.

    # Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
    # Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
    #hostGateway: antrea-gw0

    # Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
    # - geneve (default)
    # - vxlan
    # - stt
    #tunnelType: geneve

    # Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
    # If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
    # also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead.
    #defaultMTU: 1450

    # ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
    # set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
    # AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
    #serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

    # HOST can only be IP right now because there is a DNS resolution issue in current Windows support.
    # IP can be either IPv4 or IPv6. However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
    # If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.

    #activeFlowExportTimeout: "30s"

    # Provide the idle flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
    # record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no
    # packet matching this flow has been observed since the last export event.
    # Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

    # noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
    #                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
    #                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.

    # 3. The Node IP
    #transportInterface:
