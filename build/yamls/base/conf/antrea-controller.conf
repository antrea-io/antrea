# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable traceflow which provides packet tracing feature to diagnose network issue.
#  Traceflow: true

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.

# Enable collecting and exposing NetworkPolicy statistics.
#  NetworkPolicyStats: true

# Enable controlling SNAT IPs of Pod egress traffic.
#  Egress: true

# Run Kubernetes NodeIPAMController with Antrea.
#  NodeIPAM: false

# Enable flexible IPAM mode for Antrea. This mode allows to assign IP Ranges to Namespaces,
# Deployments and StatefulSets via IP Pool annotation.

# Enable managing external IPs of Services of LoadBalancer type.
#  ServiceExternalIP: false

# The port for the antrea-controller APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-controller` container must be set to the same value.

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.

# Indicates whether to use auto-generated self-signed TLS certificate.
