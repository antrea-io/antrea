# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable AntreaProxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster Services in antrea-agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic.
# AntreaProxy: true

# Name of the primary OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create for Secondary interface needs.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
# Defaults to br-int.
#Secondary_OVSBridge1: br-int0

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create for Secondary network specific tunnel needs.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
# Defaults to br-int.
#Secondary_OVSBridge2: br-int2

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode. Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to be available.
#Secondary_OVSDatapathType: system

# Runtime data directory used by Open vSwitch.
# Default value:
# - On Linux platform: /var/run/openvswitch
# - On Windows platform: C:\openvswitch\var\run\openvswitch
#Secondary_OVSRunDir:

# Name of the OVS patch port which would connected two OVS bridges per secondary inteface config.
#Secondary_OVSPatchPort: patch0

# Name of the OVS patch port peer which would connected two OVS bridges per secondary inteface config.
#Secondary_OVSPatchPortPeer: patch1

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options:
#  encap(default):    Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to external network
#                     traffic is SNAT'd.
#  noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
#                     SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
#                     supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
#  hybrid:            noEncap if source and destination Nodes are on the same subnet, otherwise encap.
#  networkPolicyOnly: Antrea enforces NetworkPolicy only, and utilizes CNI chaining and delegates Pod
#                     IPAM and connectivity to the primary CNI.
#Secondary_TrafficEncapMode: encap

# Tunnel protocols used for encapsulating traffic across Nodes. Supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - gre
# - stt
#Secondary_TunnelType: geneve
