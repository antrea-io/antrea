# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable AntreaProxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster Services in antrea-agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic.
#  AntreaProxy: true

# Enable traceflow which provides packet tracing feature to diagnose network issue.
#  Traceflow: true

# Enable NodePortLocal feature to make the pods reachable externally through NodePort
#  NodePortLocal: false

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.
#  AntreaPolicy: false

# Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each
# agent to a configured collector.
#  FlowExporter: false

# Enable collecting and exposing NetworkPolicy statistics.
#  NetworkPolicyStats: false

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode. Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to be available.
#ovsDatapathType: system

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: antrea-gw0

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options:
# encap(default):    Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to external network
#                    traffic is SNAT'd.
# noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
#                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
#                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
# hybrid:            noEncap if source and destination Nodes are on the same subnet, otherwise encap.
# networkPolicyOnly: Antrea enforces NetworkPolicy only, and utilizes CNI chaining and delegates Pod
#                    IPAM and connectivity to the primary CNI.
#
#trafficEncapMode: encap

# Whether or not to SNAT (using the Node IP) the egress traffic from a Pod to the external network.
# This option is for the noEncap traffic mode only, and the default value is false. In the noEncap
# mode, if the cluster's Pod CIDR is reachable from the external network, then the Pod traffic to
# the external network needs not be SNAT'd. In the networkPolicyOnly mode, antrea-agent never
# performs SNAT and this option will be ignored; for other modes it must be set to false.
#noSNAT: false

# Tunnel protocols used for encapsulating traffic across Nodes. Supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - gre
# - stt
#tunnelType: geneve

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
# If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
# also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead (if applicable).
#defaultMTU: 1450

# Whether or not to enable IPsec encryption of tunnel traffic. IPsec encryption is only supported
# for the GRE tunnel type.
#enableIPSecTunnel: false

# ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
# set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
# AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# ClusterIP CIDR range for IPv6 Services. It's required when using kube-proxy to provide IPv6 Service in a Dual-Stack
# cluster or an IPv6 only cluster. The value should be the same as the configuration for kube-apiserver specified by
# --service-cluster-ip-range. When AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed.
# No default value for this field.
#serviceCIDRv6:

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-agent` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10350

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.
#enablePrometheusMetrics: true

# Provide the IPFIX collector address as a string with format <HOST>:[<PORT>][:<PROTO>].
# HOST can either be the DNS name or the IP of the Flow Collector. For example,
# "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc" can be provided as DNS name to connect
# to the Antrea Flow Aggregator service. If IP, it can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
# However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
# If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.
# If no PROTO is given, we consider "tcp" as default. We support "tcp" and "udp"
# L4 transport protocols.
#flowCollectorAddr: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc:4739:tcp"

# Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module.
# Flow poll interval should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#flowPollInterval: "5s"

# Provide flow export frequency, which is the number of poll cycles elapsed before flow exporter exports flow records to
# the flow collector.
# Flow export frequency should be greater than or equal to 1.
#flowExportFrequency: 12

# Provide the port range used by NodePortLocal. When the NodePortLocal feature is enabled, a port from that range will be assigned
# whenever a Pod's container defines a specific port to be exposed (each container can define a list of ports as pod.spec.containers[].ports),
# and all Node traffic directed to that Pod will be forwarded to the Pod.
#nplPortRange: 40000-41000
