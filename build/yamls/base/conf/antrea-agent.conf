# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable AntreaProxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster Services in antrea-agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic.
#  AntreaProxy: true

# Enable EndpointSlice support in AntreaProxy. Don't enable this feature unless that EndpointSlice
# API version v1beta1 is supported and set as enabled in Kubernetes. If AntreaProxy is not enabled,
# this flag will not take effect.
#  EndpointSlice: false

# Enable traceflow which provides packet tracing feature to diagnose network issue.
#  Traceflow: true

# Enable NodePortLocal feature to make the Pods reachable externally through NodePort
#  NodePortLocal: true

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.
#  AntreaPolicy: true

# Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each
# agent to a configured collector.
#  FlowExporter: false

# Enable collecting and exposing NetworkPolicy statistics.
#  NetworkPolicyStats: true

# Enable controlling SNAT IPs of Pod egress traffic.
#  Egress: true

# Enable AntreaIPAM, which can allocate IP addresses from IPPools. AntreaIPAM is required by the
# bridging mode and allocates IPs to Pods in bridging mode.
#  AntreaIPAM: false

# Enable multicast traffic. This feature is supported only with noEncap mode.
#  Multicast: false

# Enable support for provisioning secondary network interfaces for Pods (using
# Pod annotations). At the moment, Antrea can only create secondary network
# interfaces using SR-IOV VFs on baremetal Nodes.
#  SecondaryNetwork: false

# Enable managing external IPs of Services of LoadBalancer type.
#  ServiceExternalIP: false

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode (not fully supported yet). Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to
# be available.
#ovsDatapathType: system

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: antrea-gw0

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options:
# encap(default):    Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to external network
#                    traffic is SNAT'd.
# noEncap:           Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated; Pod to external network traffic is
#                    SNAT'd if noSNAT is not set to true. Underlying network must be capable of
#                    supporting Pod traffic across IP subnets.
# hybrid:            noEncap if source and destination Nodes are on the same subnet, otherwise encap.
# networkPolicyOnly: Antrea enforces NetworkPolicy only, and utilizes CNI chaining and delegates Pod
#                    IPAM and connectivity to the primary CNI.
#
#trafficEncapMode: encap

# Whether or not to SNAT (using the Node IP) the egress traffic from a Pod to the external network.
# This option is for the noEncap traffic mode only, and the default value is false. In the noEncap
# mode, if the cluster's Pod CIDR is reachable from the external network, then the Pod traffic to
# the external network needs not be SNAT'd. In the networkPolicyOnly mode, antrea-agent never
# performs SNAT and this option will be ignored; for other modes it must be set to false.
#noSNAT: false

# Tunnel protocols used for encapsulating traffic across Nodes. If WireGuard is enabled in trafficEncryptionMode,
# this option will not take effect. Supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - gre
# - stt
# Note that "gre" is not supported for IPv6 clusters (IPv6-only or dual-stack clusters).
#tunnelType: geneve

# Determines how tunnel traffic is encrypted. Currently encryption only works with encap mode.
# It has the following options:
# - none (default):  Inter-node Pod traffic will not be encrypted.
# - ipsec:           Enable IPsec (ESP) encryption for Pod traffic across Nodes. Antrea uses
#                    Preshared Key (PSK) for IKE authentication. When IPsec tunnel is enabled,
#                    the PSK value must be passed to Antrea Agent through an environment
#                    variable: ANTREA_IPSEC_PSK.
# - wireGuard:       Enable WireGuard for tunnel traffic encryption.
#trafficEncryptionMode: none

# Enable bridging mode of Pod network on Nodes, in which the Node's transport interface is connected
# to the OVS bridge, and cross-Node/VLAN traffic from AntreaIPAM Pods (Pods whose IP addresses are
# allocated by AntreaIPAM from IPPools) is sent to the underlay network via the uplink, and
# forwarded/routed by the underlay network.
# This option requires the `AntreaIPAM` feature gate to be enabled. At this moment, it supports only
# IPv4 and Linux Nodes, and can be enabled only when `ovsDatapathType` is `system`,
# `trafficEncapMode` is `noEncap`, and `noSNAT` is true.
#enableBridgingMode: false

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
# If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
# also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead (if applicable).
#defaultMTU: 0

# wireGuard specifies WireGuard related configurations.
wireGuard:
#  The port for WireGuard to receive traffic.
#  port: 51820

egress:
#  exceptCIDRs is the CIDR ranges to which outbound Pod traffic will not be SNAT'd by Egresses.
#  exceptCIDRs: []

# ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
# set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
# AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# ClusterIP CIDR range for IPv6 Services. It's required when using kube-proxy to provide IPv6 Service in a Dual-Stack
# cluster or an IPv6 only cluster. The value should be the same as the configuration for kube-apiserver specified by
# --service-cluster-ip-range. When AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed.
# No default value for this field.
#serviceCIDRv6:

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-agent` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10350

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.
#enablePrometheusMetrics: true

# Provide the IPFIX collector address as a string with format <HOST>:[<PORT>][:<PROTO>].
# HOST can either be the DNS name or the IP of the Flow Collector. For example,
# "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc" can be provided as DNS name to connect
# to the Antrea Flow Aggregator service. If IP, it can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
# However, IPv6 address should be wrapped with [].
# If PORT is empty, we default to 4739, the standard IPFIX port.
# If no PROTO is given, we consider "tls" as default. We support "tls", "tcp" and
# "udp" protocols. "tls" is used for securing communication between flow exporter and
# flow aggregator.
#flowCollectorAddr: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc:4739:tls"

# Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the
# flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module. Flow poll interval
# should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#flowPollInterval: "5s"

# Provide the active flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
# record is sent to the collector for active flows. Thus, for flows with a continuous
# stream of packets, a flow record will be exported to the collector once the elapsed
# time since the last export event is equal to the value of this timeout.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#activeFlowExportTimeout: "30s"

# Provide the idle flow export timeout, which is the timeout after which a flow
# record is sent to the collector for idle flows. A flow is considered idle if no
# packet matching this flow has been observed since the last export event.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#idleFlowExportTimeout: "15s"

nodePortLocal:
# Enable NodePortLocal, a feature used to make Pods reachable using port forwarding on the host. To
# enable this feature, you need to set "enable" to true, and ensure that the NodePortLocal feature
# gate is also enabled (which is the default).
#  enable: false
# Provide the port range used by NodePortLocal. When the NodePortLocal feature is enabled, a port
# from that range will be assigned whenever a Pod's container defines a specific port to be exposed
# (each container can define a list of ports as pod.spec.containers[].ports), and all Node traffic
# directed to that port will be forwarded to the Pod.
#  portRange: 61000-62000

# Provide the address of Kubernetes apiserver, to override any value provided in kubeconfig or InClusterConfig.
# Defaults to "". It must be a host string, a host:port pair, or a URL to the base of the apiserver.
#kubeAPIServerOverride: ""

# Comma-separated list of Cipher Suites. If omitted, the default Go Cipher Suites will be used.
# https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants
# Note that TLS1.3 Cipher Suites cannot be added to the list. But the apiserver will always
# prefer TLS1.3 Cipher Suites whenever possible.
#tlsCipherSuites:

# TLS min version from: VersionTLS10, VersionTLS11, VersionTLS12, VersionTLS13.
#tlsMinVersion:

# The name of the interface on Node which is used for tunneling or routing the traffic across Nodes.
# If there are multiple IP addresses configured on the interface, the first one is used. The IP
# address used for tunneling or routing traffic to remote Nodes is decided in the following order of
# preference (from highest to lowest):
# 1. transportInterface
# 2. transportInterfaceCIDRs
# 3. The Node IP
#transportInterface:

# The names of the interfaces on Nodes that are used to forward multicast traffic.
# Defaults to transport interface if not set.
#multicastInterfaces: []

# The network CIDRs of the interface on Node which is used for tunneling or routing the traffic across
# Nodes. If there are multiple interfaces configured the same network CIDR, the first one is used. The
# IP address used for tunneling or routing traffic to remote Nodes is decided in the following order of
# preference (from highest to lowest):
# 1. transportInterface
# 2. transportInterfaceCIDRs
# 3. The Node IP
#transportInterfaceCIDRs: [<IPv4 CIDR>,<IPv6 CIDR>]

# Option antreaProxy contains AntreaProxy related configuration options.
antreaProxy:
  # ProxyAll tells antrea-agent to proxy all Service traffic, including NodePort, LoadBalancer, and ClusterIP traffic,
  # regardless of where they come from. Therefore, running kube-proxy is no longer required. This requires the AntreaProxy
  # feature to be enabled.
  # Note that this option is experimental. If kube-proxy is removed, option kubeAPIServerOverride must be used to access
  # apiserver directly.
  #proxyAll: false
  # A string array of values which specifies the host IPv4/IPv6 addresses for NodePort. Values can be valid IP blocks.
  # (e.g. 1.2.3.0/24, 1.2.3.4/32). An empty string slice is meant to select all host IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
  # Note that the option is only valid when proxyAll is true.
  #nodePortAddresses: []
  # An array of string values to specify a list of Services which should be ignored by AntreaProxy (traffic to these
  # Services will not be load-balanced). Values can be a valid ClusterIP (e.g. 10.11.1.2) or a Service name
  # with Namespace (e.g. kube-system/kube-dns)
  #skipServices: []
  # When ProxyLoadBalancerIPs is set to false, AntreaProxy no longer load-balances traffic destined to the
  # External IPs of LoadBalancer Services. This is useful when the external LoadBalancer provides additional
  # capabilities (e.g. TLS termination) and it is desirable for Pod-to-ExternalIP traffic to be sent to the
  # external LoadBalancer instead of being load-balanced to an Endpoint directly by AntreaProxy.
  # Note that setting ProxyLoadBalancerIPs to false usually only makes sense when ProxyAll is set to true and
  # kube-proxy is removed from the cluser, otherwise kube-proxy will still load-balance this traffic.
  #proxyLoadBalancerIPs: true

# The role in which Antrea Agent is working. Supported values:
# - Node (default)
# - VM
# - BM
#agentRole: Node

# The namespace to create the ExternalEntity for the VM/BM object.
# The default value is "default".
# It is used only when AgentRole is VM or BM.
#namespace: default
