# FeatureGates is a map of feature names to bools that enable or disable experimental features.
featureGates:
# Enable AntreaProxy which provides ServiceLB for in-cluster Services in antrea-agent.
# It should be enabled on Windows, otherwise NetworkPolicy will not take effect on
# Service traffic. Antrea proxy doesn't support an IPv6 only cluster or a Dual-Stack cluster
# before PR #1102[https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/antrea/pull/1102] is merged.
#  AntreaProxy: false

# Enable traceflow which provides packet tracing feature to diagnose network issue.
#  Traceflow: false

# Enable Antrea ClusterNetworkPolicy feature to complement K8s NetworkPolicy for cluster admins
# to define security policies which apply to the entire cluster, and Antrea NetworkPolicy
# feature that supports priorities, rule actions and externalEntities in the future.
#  AntreaPolicy: false

# Enable flowexporter which exports polled conntrack connections as IPFIX flow records from each agent to a configured collector.
#  FlowExporter: false

# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode. Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to be available.
#ovsDatapathType: system

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: antrea-gw0

# Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
# - geneve (default)
# - vxlan
# - gre
# - stt
#tunnelType: geneve

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod.
# If omitted, antrea-agent will discover the MTU of the Node's primary interface and
# also adjust MTU to accommodate for tunnel encapsulation overhead (if applicable).
#defaultMTU: 1450

# Whether or not to enable IPsec encryption of tunnel traffic. IPsec encryption is only supported
# for the GRE tunnel type.
#enableIPSecTunnel: false

# ClusterIP CIDR range for Services. It's required when AntreaProxy is not enabled, and should be
# set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver. When
# AntreaProxy is enabled, this parameter is not needed and will be ignored if provided.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options
# encap(default): Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to outbound traffic is masqueraded.
# noEncap: Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated, but Pod to outbound traffic is masqueraded.
#          Underlying network must be capable of supporting Pod traffic across IP subnet.
# hybrid: noEncap if worker Nodes on same subnet, otherwise encap.
# networkPolicyOnly: Antrea enforces NetworkPolicy only, and utilizes CNI chaining and delegates Pod IPAM and connectivity to primary CNI.
#
#trafficEncapMode: encap

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-agent` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10350

# Enable metrics exposure via Prometheus. Initializes Prometheus metrics listener.
#enablePrometheusMetrics: false

# Provide flow collector address as string with format <IP>:<port>[:<proto>], where proto is tcp or udp. This also enables
# the flow exporter that sends IPFIX flow records of conntrack flows on OVS bridge. If no L4 transport proto is given,
# we consider tcp as default.
#flowCollectorAddr: ""

# Provide flow poll interval as a duration string. This determines how often the flow exporter dumps connections from the conntrack module.
# Flow poll interval should be greater than or equal to 1s (one second).
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#flowPollInterval: "5s"

# Provide flow export frequency, which is the number of poll cycles elapsed before flow exporter exports flow records to
# the flow collector.
# Flow export frequency should be greater than or equal to 1.
#flowExportFrequency: 12
