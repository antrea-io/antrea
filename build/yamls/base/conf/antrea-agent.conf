# Name of the OpenVSwitch bridge antrea-agent will create and use.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing OpenVSwitch bridges.
#ovsBridge: br-int

# Datapath type to use for the OpenVSwitch bridge created by Antrea. Supported values are:
# - system
# - netdev
# 'system' is the default value and corresponds to the kernel datapath. Use 'netdev' to run
# OVS in userspace mode. Userspace mode requires the tun device driver to be available.
#ovsDatapathType: system

# Name of the interface antrea-agent will create and use for host <--> pod communication.
# Make sure it doesn't conflict with your existing interfaces.
#hostGateway: gw0

# Encapsulation mode for communication between Pods across Nodes, supported values:
# - vxlan (default)
# - geneve
# - gre
# - stt
#tunnelType: vxlan

# Default MTU to use for the host gateway interface and the network interface of each Pod. If
# omitted, antrea-agent will default this value to 1450 to accommodate for tunnel encapsulate
# overhead.
#defaultMTU: 1450

# Whether or not to enable IPsec encryption of tunnel traffic. IPsec encryption is only supported
# for the GRE tunnel type.
#enableIPSecTunnel: false

# CIDR Range for services in cluster. It's required to support egress network policy, should
# be set to the same value as the one specified by --service-cluster-ip-range for kube-apiserver.
#serviceCIDR: 10.96.0.0/12

# Determines how traffic is encapsulated. It has the following options
# encap(default): Inter-node Pod traffic is always encapsulated and Pod to outbound traffic is masqueraded.
# noEncap: Inter-node Pod traffic is not encapsulated, but Pod to outbound traffic is masqueraded.
#          Underlying network must be capable of supporting Pod traffic across IP subnet.
# hybrid: noEncap if worker Nodes on same subnet, otherwise encap.
# networkPolicyOnly: Antrea enforces NetworkPolicy only, and utilizes CNI chaining and delegates Pod IPAM and connectivity to primary CNI.
#
#trafficEncapMode: encap

# The port for the antrea-agent APIServer to serve on.
# Note that if it's set to another value, the `containerPort` of the `api` port of the
# `antrea-agent` container must be set to the same value.
#apiPort: 10350
