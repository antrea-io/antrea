# Provide the flow collector address as string with format <IP>:<port>[:<proto>], where proto is tcp or udp.
# If no L4 transport proto is given, we consider tcp as default.

# Provide the active flow record timeout as a duration string. This determines
# how often the flow aggregator exports the active flow records to the flow
# collector. Thus, for flows with a continuous stream of packets, a flow record
# will be exported to the collector once the elapsed time since the last export
# event in the flow aggregator is equal to the value of this timeout.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#activeFlowRecordTimeout: 60s

# Provide the inactive flow record timeout as a duration string. This determines
# how often the flow aggregator exports the inactive flow records to the flow
# collector. A flow record is considered to be inactive if no matching record
# has been received by the flow aggregator in the specified interval.
# Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
#inactiveFlowRecordTimeout: 90s

# Provide the transport protocol for the flow aggregator collecting process, which is tls, tcp or udp.
#aggregatorTransportProtocol: "tls"

# Provide DNS name or IP address of flow aggregator for generating TLS certificate. It must match
# the flowCollectorAddr parameter in the antrea-agent config.
#flowAggregatorAddress: "flow-aggregator.flow-aggregator.svc"

# Provide the 32-bit Observation Domain ID which will uniquely identify this instance of the flow
# aggregator to an external flow collector. If omitted, an Observation Domain ID will be generated
# from the persistent cluster UUID generated by Antrea. Failing that (e.g. because the cluster UUID
# is not available), a value will be randomly generated, which may vary across restarts of the flow
# aggregator.
