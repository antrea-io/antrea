# We disable cgo to avoid the following issue when building
# github.com/containers/storage (an indirect dependency of Octant).
# The code that requires cgo is not actually used by Octant / us, so there is no
# issue associated with disabling cgo. Note that when  we build the plugin
# binaries to upload them as release assets, cgo is always disabled.
