# HostNetworkMode determines how antrea-agent implements Node host network netfilter rules required by Antrea
# functionalities and features, using either "iptables" or "nftables". The default value is "iptables". If "nftables"
# is specified, the NFTablesHostNetworkMode feature gate must be enabled; otherwise, antrea-agent will fail to start.
# If the above condition is met but nftables is not supported or unavailable on the Node, antrea-agent will also fail
# to start. Currently, nftables support is limited to the following features:
#   - AntreaProxy (proxyAll)
