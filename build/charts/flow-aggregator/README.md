The Secret must be created in the Namespace in which the Flow Aggregator is deployed, and it must contain the ca.crt key. |
| flowCollector.tls.clientSecretName | string | `""` | Name of the Secret containing the client's certificate and private key for mTLS. If omitted, client authentication will be disabled. The Secret must be created in Namespace in which the Flow Aggregator is deployed, and it must be of type kubernetes.io/tls and contain the tls.crt and tls.key keys. |
| flowCollector.tls.enable | bool | `false` | Enable TLS. |
| flowCollector.tls.minVersion | string | VersionTLS12 | Minimum TLS version from: VersionTLS12, VersionTLS13. |

| flowLogger.enable | bool | `false` | Determine whether to enable exporting flow records to a local log file. |

| recordContents.podLabels | bool | `false` | Determine whether source and destination Pod labels will be included in the flow records. |
