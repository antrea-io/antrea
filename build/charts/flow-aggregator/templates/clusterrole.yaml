  # This is the content of built-in role kube-system/extension-apiserver-authentication-reader.
  # But it doesn't have list/watch permission before K8s v1.17.0 so the extension apiserver (antrea-agent) will
  # have permission issue after bumping up apiserver library to a version that supports dynamic authentication.
  # See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85375
  # To support K8s clusters older than v1.17.0, we grant the required permissions directly instead of relying on
  # the extension-apiserver-authentication role.
