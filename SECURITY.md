# Security Procedures
The Antrea community holds security in the highest regard.
The community adopted this security disclosure policy to ensure vulnerabilities are responsibly handled.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a vulnerability, please work with the Antrea maintainers to fix it and disclose the issue responsibly.
All security issues, confirmed or suspected, should be reported privately.
Please avoid using github issues, and instead report the vulnerability to projectantrea-maintainers@googlegroups.com.

A vulnerability report should be filed if any of the following applies:
* You have discovered and confirmed a vulnerability in Antrea.
* You believe Antrea might be vulnerable to some published [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/).
* You have found a potential security flaw in Antrea but you're not yet sure whether there's a viable attack vector.
* You have confirmed or suspect any of Antrea's dependencies has a vulnerability.

### Vulnerability report template
Provide a descriptive subject and include the following information in the body:
* Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability  (scripts, screenshots, packet captures, manual procedures, etc.).
* Describe the effects of the vulnerability on the Kubernetes cluster, on the applications running on it, and on the underlying infrastructure, if applicable.
* How the vulnerability affects Antrea workflows.
* Potential attack vectors and an estimation of the attack surface, if applicable.
* Other software that was used to expose the vulnerability.
 
## Responding to a vulnerability

A coordinator is assigned to each reported security issue. The coordinator is a member from the Antrea maintainers team, and will drive the fix and disclosure process.
At the moment reports are received via email at projectantrea-maintainers@googlegroups.com.
The first steps performed by the coordinator are to confirm the validity of the report and send an embargo reminder to all parties involved.
Antrea maintainers and issue reporters will review the issue for confirmation of impact and determination of affected components.

With reference to the scale reported below, reported vulnerabilities will be disclosed and treated as regular issues if their issue risk is low (level 4 or higher in the scale).
For these lower-risk issues the fix process will proceed with the usual github workflow.

### Reference taxonomy for issue risk
1. Vulnerability must be fixed in master and any other supported branch.
2. Vulnerability must be fixed in master only for next release.
3. Vulnerability in experimental features or troubleshooting code.
4. Vulnerability without practical attack vector (e.g.: needs GUID guessing).
5. Not a vulnerability per se, but an opportunity to strengthen security (in code, architecture, protocols, and/or processes).
6. Not a vulnerability or a strengthening opportunity.
7. Vulnerability only exist in some PR or non-release branch.

## Developing a patch for a vulnerability

This part of the process applies only to confirmed vulnerabilities.
The reporter and Antrea maintainers, plus anyone they deem necessary to develop and validate a fix will be included the discussion.

**Please refrain from creating a PR for the fix!**

A fix is proposed as a patch to the current master branch, formatted with:
```
git format-patch --stdout HEAD~1 > path/to/local/file.patch
```
and then sent to projectantrea-maintainers@googlegroups.com.

**Please don't push the patch to the Antrea fork on your github account!**

Patch review will be performed via email. Reviewers will suggest modifications and/or improvements, and then pre-approve it for merging. 
Pre-approval will ensure patches can be fast-tracked through public code review later at disclosure time.

## Disclosing the vulnerability

In preparation for this, at least a maintainer must be available to help pushing the fix at disclosure time.

At the disclosure time, one of the maintainers (or the reporter) will open an issue on github and create a PR with the patch for the master branch and any other applicable branch.
Available maintainers will fast-track approvals and merge the patch.

Regardless of the owner of the issue and the corresponding PR, the original reporter and the submitter of the fix will be properly credited.
As for the git history, the commit message and author of the pre-approved patch will be preserved in the final patch submitted into the Antrea repository.

### Notes

At the moment the Antrea project does not have a process to assign a CVE to a confirmed vulnerability.
