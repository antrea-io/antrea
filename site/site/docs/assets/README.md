## SVG images

The SVG images / diagrams in this directory have been created using
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and exported as PNG files - which can be embedded in Makrdown
files. If you edit these images, please re-export them as PNG with a 300 dpi resolution. If you
create new SVG images / diagrams for documentation, please check-in both the SVG source and the
exported PNG file.
