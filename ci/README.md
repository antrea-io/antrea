## Antrea CI

This directory includes all the scripts required to run CI on Antrea.

For information about our Jenkins CI jobs and how to run the same tests locally,
see [here](jenkins/README.md).

File [k8s-conformance-image-version](k8s-conformance-image-version) stores the
version number of the K8s conformance container image we currently use to run
tests.
