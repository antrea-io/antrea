# Mellanox CI

Mellanox CI is used to test hardware offload in the Antrea project.
It deploys Kubernetes with the Antrea image and tests whether the
OVS has hardware offload capabilities or not.

## Workflow

The CI tests run on a single node cluster with a ConnectX5 NIC card,
the latest stable Kubernetes binaries are built each time the scripts
run. In addition to Kubernetes and Antrea, the scripts deploy
Multus CNI, SRIOV device plugin, and container networking plugins. The
versions for the used components are summarized as follow:

* Kubernetes: Latest stable.
* Antrea: Image built from pull request.
* Multus: A nightly pulled latest stable Multus image.
* SRIOV device plugin: A nightly built image from the main branch.
* container networking plugins: Latest binaries built from the main branch.

The CI uses three scripts to run the tests:

* start_ci.sh: Build and deploy the testing environment.
* test.sh: Test the hardware offload.
* stop_ci.sh: Stop and clean the testing environment.

The CI can be triggered by commenting `/test-hw-offload` on an
opened pull request.

## Configurations

The scripts use Bash environment variables to configure their behavior.
The following table shows what variables can be configured:

|  Variable<br />(Default value)  |  Comments |
